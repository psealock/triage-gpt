{"prompt":"### Context\r\n\r\nIn Rukib team, we are maintaining the [WooCommerce Blocks](https:\/\/github.com\/woocommerce\/woocommerce-blocks) plugin! Couple of months ago we did a research spike (pdFofs-mB-p2) about managing extensions that don't support the Cart & Checkout Blocks. One of our propositions was to declare (in)compatibility with the C&C Blocks (pdFofs-mB-p2#declare-in-compatibility-with-the-cart-checkout-blocks) using the same approach in [HPOS compatibility declaration](https:\/\/github.com\/woocommerce\/woocommerce\/wiki\/High-Performance-Order-Storage-Upgrade-Recipe-Book#declaring-extension-incompatibility). During one of our pair programming and brainstorming sessions (pca54o-4NP-p2#declaring-in-compatibly-with-the-c-c-blocks) we worked in creating a prouf of concept for declaring (in)compatibility with the Cart & Checkout Blocks feature.\r\n\r\nDeclaring (in)compatibility is simple:\r\n- Declare WC tested up to in the main plugin file(s)\r\n- Add the correct code snippet to the main plugin file(s)\r\n\r\nThe code snippet used for declaring (in)compatibility with [HPOS](https:\/\/github.com\/woocommerce\/woocommerce\/wiki\/High-Performance-Order-Storage-Upgrade-Recipe-Book#declaring-extension-incompatibility):\r\n\r\n```PHP\r\nadd_action( 'before_woocommerce_init', function() {\r\n    if ( class_exists( '\\Automattic\\WooCommerce\\Utilities\\FeaturesUtil' ) ) {\r\n        \\Automattic\\WooCommerce\\Utilities\\FeaturesUtil::declare_compatibility( 'custom_order_tables', __FILE__, true );\r\n    }\r\n} );\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, the function of interest is: `declare_compatibility( 'custom_order_tables', FILE, true );`, see [function definition](https:\/\/href.li\/?https:\/\/github.com\/woocommerce\/woocommerce\/blob\/trunk\/plugins\/woocommerce\/src\/Utilities\/FeaturesUtil.php#L45-L67):\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/woocommerce\/woocommerce\/blob\/c3d62f113addbbf820ed5e8103a0a052092efc00\/plugins\/woocommerce\/src\/Utilities\/FeaturesUtil.php#L45-L67\r\n\r\nIn theory, we want to replace the `custom_order_tables` feature_id by a C&C Blocks feature_id (e.g., `cart_checkout_blocks`). During our research, we realized that only the WooCommerce features in `WooCommerce -> Settings -> Advanced -> Features` can use the `declare_compatibility` function:\r\n\r\n![image](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/14235870\/212312501-2ee56ff3-b78e-4f53-93bc-675947ed8071.png)\r\n\r\nIn other words, the current implementation of the `declare_compatibility` function doesn’t work for the Cart & Checkout Blocks feature.\r\n\r\n### Solutions\r\n\r\nI this case, we have two options:\r\n\r\n- In Woo Blocks, create the compatibility declaration API from scratch. This, I believe, is a bad idea: we will duplicate the same feature, and we will not have a single source of truth!\r\n- Add support for the Cart & Checkout Blocks in the declaring compatibility feature\r\n\r\nWe eventually chose to go with the second solution!\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [3834300886,3837257959]"}

{"prompt":"> **Note**\r\n> **TL;DR** is there a way we could install and run phpcs-changed from the root of the Git repo instead of only from `plugins\/woocommerce`?\r\n\r\nRight now phpcs-changed is run as part of a GitHub workflow whenever you push changes to a pull request, which is great because it only shows you linting errors on the lines you changed\/added, instead of in each entire file. However, it'd be even better if I could run this command locally before I push changes up to GitHub, so I don't have to wait for all the checks to finish to know if I have linting errors.\r\n\r\nIn `plugins\/woocommerce\/composer.json` I see the `phpcs-pre-commit` [script](https:\/\/github.com\/woocommerce\/woocommerce\/blob\/e05a191156aa9c59d8bf94429fba4dbc1a92519e\/plugins\/woocommerce\/composer.json#L91-L93), but A) it doesn't seem to actually run when I attempt a commit, and B) the command doesn't work on it's own as it currently is.\r\n\r\nI have tried running phpcs-changed manually a few different ways, and there does not appear to be any way to successfully use the instance that gets installed and managed by composer in the `plugins\/woocommerce` directory. What happens is, with the right command line arguments, it _can_ be run, but it shows you every linting error in each file instead of just on the changed lines.\r\n\r\nExample command, run from the `plugins\/woocommerce` directory (this is to compare a PR branch to trunk, where everything has already been committed):\r\n```bash\r\ncomposer exec phpcs-changed -- -s --git --git-base trunk $(git diff $(git merge-base HEAD trunk) --name-only -- '*.php')\r\n```\r\n\r\nEventually I discovered that the issue is that you have to run the command from the directory where the composer.json file is located (`plugins\/woocommerce`), but the phpcs-changed command assumes that you are in the root of the Git repository, so it can't find the files that you're specifying when it's getting the linting results from the base branch. Thus it assumes that all of the changed files are brand new and shows you every linting error.\r\n\r\nThe workaround I'm using right now is to install phpcs-changed and some other necessary packages globally and then I can run it from the Git repo root without having to go through composer. However, this is not ideal because:\r\n* It makes the monorepo less self-contained, and takes us farther away from the goal of having everything ready to go after just running the install command.\r\n* I think it would actually be great if phpcs-changed could be run on the pre-commit hook.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [3844183371]"}

When the calendar and the clock in the real life reach 2022-10-10 00:00:00 99 products shows the original price but the edited keep showing the sale price until 23:59:59 of the same day\r\n\r\nThat can be avoided by checking the date before the save and change 2022-10-10 to 2022-10-09, but i don't think is reasonable, at least not reasonable for a programmer XD.\r\nThe other way is using a hook filter to change the timestamp saving on import, but why admin interface and importer must invalidate each other? I was struggling between post this in bug section or in enhancement.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you need the steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Install WooCommerce in a clean Wordpress installation\r\n2. Create a product named \"Test\" with regular price to 10\r\n3. Export the product with these columns (ID,Date sale price ends,Sale price)\r\n4. Edit the exported CSV with the current day you are doing this below \"Date sale price ends\" column\r\n5. Edit the exported CSV with 5 below \"Sale price\" column\r\n6. Import the CSV to update \"Test\" product by ID\r\n7. Visit the product in frontend, should be shown with the regular price 10 without any sale (because now the date is the 00:00:00 of today)\r\n8. Enter inside the product edit in admin\r\n9. Press Update button doing nothing else\r\n10. Visit the product in frontend, should be shown with sale price (because now the date is the 23:59:59 of today)\r\n\r\nThanks for reading, i wanted to be more clear and specific as possible because are years now that i'm experiencing this and now i decided to write here.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [3837257959]"}

{"prompt":"Currently, WooCommerce only supports the PUT method for updating resources. However, there are situations where a more granular update of a resource is required, without having to send the entire resource in the request. This is where the PATCH method comes in handy.\r\n\r\nFor example, let's say you have a product in WooCommerce with multiple attributes such as title, description, price, etc. If you wanted to update just the price of the product, you would have to send the entire product object in the request body using the PUT method. This can be inefficient, especially if the product object is large.\r\n\r\nWith the PATCH method, you can send only the fields that need to be updated in the request body, thus reducing the amount of data being sent over the network. This can lead to improved performance and reduced network latency.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the PATCH method allows for partial updates of a resource, which can be useful in scenarios where you need to update only certain fields of a resource, without affecting the others.\r\n\r\nTherefore, adding support for the PATCH method in WooCommerce would provide more flexibility and efficiency in updating resources, and would align with RESTful best practices for API design.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nUsing the PUT method with the entire resource: While not as efficient as the PATCH method, using the PUT method with the entire resource would still allow for updating of the resource. This method may be sufficient for smaller resources, but could be inefficient for larger resources.\r\n\r\nCreating custom endpoints: Instead of using the existing endpoints in WooCommerce, custom endpoints could be created to support the PATCH method. This would require additional development effort but would provide more granular control over the API.\r\n\r\nUsing third-party plugins: There may be third-party plugins available that add support for the PATCH method in WooCommerce. However, using third-party plugins can introduce additional dependencies and potential security risks.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [2258932484]"}

{"prompt":":**\r\nVendor\/Partner request: Our Bulk Table Editor uses date + time to schedule sales. Customers is complaining about the sale is not ending. We did some research and found that the cron job for sales ( wc_scheduled_sales ) just runs once a day. So having a sale from 09:00 to 12:00 the same day (or the like) is not possible anymore. This used to work. We manually changed this cron job to run every minute and problem solved. I think many WooCommerce users think that once a day is OK but if you schedule a sale using time it will not do. So our suggestion is: 1. In WooCommerce settings make an option to change this cron job. 2. Make a hook (filter) so developers can change the sales cron job (recurrence).

{"prompt":"As it stands, Turborepo seems to invalidate the cache when input files change as you expect it to. For some reason, however, it looks like files aren't always being rebuilt when they should be. I think this problem is being caused by TypeScript's incremental builds. As far as I can tell, `tsc` does not always build the project when you expect it to. I have a few thoughts:\r\n\r\n* This may relate to the fact that `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` is not being cached as a build output. Is it possible this might be causing things to not be rebuilt even though they've changed? This _should_ be cached as an output, whether it's the problem or not, since it is a build artifact.\r\n* Does TypeScript pick up on the fact that the dependency has been rebuilt even though none of the output files have been rebuilt? I know TypeScript supports references and composite projects, maybe we've misconfigured something and they aren't seeing each other?\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nTypeScript should run the build when the files have changed.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nTypeScript is not running the build when the files have changed.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Run the following commands:\r\n```bash\r\ngit clean -fdx\r\npnpm install\r\n# Run the build a few times and make sure we're getting FULL TURBO each time.\r\npnpm run build --filter=@woocommerce\/currency\r\n```\r\n2.

By default, all attributes are created globally.

For example, if the user adds a new value to a \"Size\" option, we should auto-create all the new variations based on the new size value.\r\n- [x] When at least one option is created, we should automatically create variations from all options.

If the attribute is added in the options section, the flag will be enabled. There will be no way to enable or disable the flag once the attribute is added. To do that, users need to remove an attribute and add it in a different section: Attributes -> Options or Options -> Attributes.\r\n- [x] If an attribute is added in one section, it can’t be selected in another. Users have to remove it from one section and add it to another. We would detect when an attribute was already added somewhere else and let users move it from one section to another.\r\n- [ ] When users add a global attribute to Attributes, we automatically add its first value. When they add it to Options, we add all of its values.\r\n- [x] Users can select global attributes in both places. If they create new values, they’re added to the attribute but not selected in the products it’s assigned to.\r\n- [ ] Attributes and options can be sorted separately. Options are, by default, hidden from the product description.

Currently our use of [`TabPanel`](https:\/\/github.com\/WordPress\/gutenberg\/tree\/trunk\/packages\/components\/src\/tab-panel) relies on having nested children with the `ProductFormTab` component which won't be possible with the SlotFills as fills will be wrapped by the Slot component.\r\n\r\nAlso note that the `TabPanel` component requires the tab name, title, and className as standalone data.\r\n\r\nThere could be a couple options (part of this issue is determining the best approach):\r\n- Refactor our current use of `TabPanel` within [ProductFormLayout](https:\/\/github.com\/woocommerce\/woocommerce\/blob\/trunk\/plugins\/woocommerce-admin\/client\/products\/layout\/product-form-layout.tsx#L15) to integrate fills, we can make use of the `useSlot` hooks for these and retrieve the necessary data from there. \r\n- Integrate tabs directly with the `WooProductFormTabItem` fill component as part #36394, asking for the additional title, name data.\r\n- Make use of a React provider within our use of `TabPanel` in [ProductFormLayout](https:\/\/github.com\/woocommerce\/woocommerce\/blob\/trunk\/plugins\/woocommerce-admin\/client\/products\/layout\/product-form-layout.tsx#L15) and instead of relying on Children we have `ProductFormTab` register within the provider.

However all these third parties only partially support WooCommerce because there is no return management system. Such a system needs the following functionality\r\n- Register a return\r\n- Apply different states to a return (eg. Expected, In Progress, Approved, Completed)\r\n- Refund the return or create a coupon\r\n\r\nAll the other big E-commerce platforms already have this functionality.\r\n- Shopify\r\n- Lightspeed\r\n- Magento 1 & Magento 2\r\n- Shopware\r\n- BigCommerce\r\n\r\nThe third parties(multiple) advise us explicitly to switch to a different platform. Which is something we are almost forced to do to keep everything running operationally.\r\n\r\nSure there are some plugins that can do this but third parties don't support plugin functionality but only core functionality. And this is an essential part for any e-commerce website.\r\n\r\nIs this something that is planned or possible to integrate in the near future?\r\n\r\n\r\n<\/div>\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [3837257959]"}
