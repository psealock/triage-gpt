{"prompt":"Currently, WooCommerce only supports the PUT method for updating resources. However, there are situations where a more granular update of a resource is required, without having to send the entire resource in the request. This is where the PATCH method comes in handy.\r\n\r\nFor example, let's say you have a product in WooCommerce with multiple attributes such as title, description, price, etc. If you wanted to update just the price of the product, you would have to send the entire product object in the request body using the PUT method. This can be inefficient, especially if the product object is large.\r\n\r\nWith the PATCH method, you can send only the fields that need to be updated in the request body, thus reducing the amount of data being sent over the network. This can lead to improved performance and reduced network latency.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the PATCH method allows for partial updates of a resource, which can be useful in scenarios where you need to update only certain fields of a resource, without affecting the others.\r\n\r\nTherefore, adding support for the PATCH method in WooCommerce would provide more flexibility and efficiency in updating resources, and would align with RESTful best practices for API design.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nUsing the PUT method with the entire resource: While not as efficient as the PATCH method, using the PUT method with the entire resource would still allow for updating of the resource. This method may be sufficient for smaller resources, but could be inefficient for larger resources.\r\n\r\nCreating custom endpoints: Instead of using the existing endpoints in WooCommerce, custom endpoints could be created to support the PATCH method. This would require additional development effort but would provide more granular control over the API.\r\n\r\nUsing third-party plugins: There may be third-party plugins available that add support for the PATCH method in WooCommerce. However, using third-party plugins can introduce additional dependencies and potential security risks.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [2258932484]"}

By running the following code will generate fatal error.\r\n```\r\n$order   = wc_get_order( 1347 );\r\n$earning = $order->get_total_shipping() - $order->get_total_shipping_refunded();\r\n\r\necho $earning;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe return type of the above-mentioned methods in the `WC_Abstract_Order` class should be `float`, instead of `string`. \r\n1. `get_shipping_total()`\r\n2. `get_shipping_tax()`\r\n3. `get_discount_total()`\r\n4. `get_discount_tax()`\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nRight now, the return type of the following methods in the `WC_Abstract_Order` class is `string`, which may generate a fatal error in some specific cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Go to `WooCommerce` > `Orders` > `Add Order`.\r\n2. It will generate an order with an ID.\r\n3. Leave the order creation page without clicking the `Create` button. So, the order's `post_status` will be `auto-draft`.\r\n4. Now, get the order using the `wc_get_order()` method.\r\n5. Try to do some calculations using any of the above-mentioned methods as per below codes. It will throw fatal errors.\r\n```\r\n$order   = wc_get_order( 1347 );\r\n$earning = $order->get_total_shipping() - $order->get_total_shipping_refunded();\r\n\r\necho $earning;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [1891051437,1891051453,1891051459]"}

{"prompt":"### Context\r\n\r\nIn Rukib team, we are maintaining the [WooCommerce Blocks](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks) plugin! Couple of months ago we did a research spike (pdFofs-mB-p2) about managing extensions that don't support the Cart & Checkout Blocks. One of our propositions was to declare (in)compatibility with the C&C Blocks (pdFofs-mB-p2#declare-in-compatibility-with-the-cart-checkout-blocks) using the same approach in [HPOS compatibility declaration](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/wiki/High-Performance-Order-Storage-Upgrade-Recipe-Book#declaring-extension-incompatibility). During one of our pair programming and brainstorming sessions (pca54o-4NP-p2#declaring-in-compatibly-with-the-c-c-blocks) we worked in creating a prouf of concept for declaring (in)compatibility with the Cart & Checkout Blocks feature.\r\n\r\nDeclaring (in)compatibility is simple:\r\n- Declare WC tested up to in the main plugin file(s)\r\n- Add the correct code snippet to the main plugin file(s)\r\n\r\nThe code snippet used for declaring (in)compatibility with [HPOS](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/wiki/High-Performance-Order-Storage-Upgrade-Recipe-Book#declaring-extension-incompatibility):\r\n\r\n```PHP\r\nadd_action( 'before_woocommerce_init', function() {\r\n    if ( class_exists( '\\Automattic\\WooCommerce\\Utilities\\FeaturesUtil' ) ) {\r\n        \\Automattic\\WooCommerce\\Utilities\\FeaturesUtil::declare_compatibility( 'custom_order_tables', __FILE__, true );\r\n    }\r\n} );\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, the function of interest is: `declare_compatibility( 'custom_order_tables', FILE, true );`, see [function definition](https://href.li/?https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/trunk/plugins/woocommerce/src/Utilities/FeaturesUtil.php#L45-L67):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/c3d62f113addbbf820ed5e8103a0a052092efc00/plugins/woocommerce/src/Utilities/FeaturesUtil.php#L45-L67\r\n\r\nIn theory, we want to replace the `custom_order_tables` feature_id by a C&C Blocks feature_id (e.g., `cart_checkout_blocks`). During our research, we realized that only the WooCommerce features in `WooCommerce -> Settings -> Advanced -> Features` can use the `declare_compatibility` function:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14235870/212312501-2ee56ff3-b78e-4f53-93bc-675947ed8071.png)\r\n\r\nIn other words, the current implementation of the `declare_compatibility` function doesn’t work for the Cart & Checkout Blocks feature.\r\n\r\n### Solutions\r\n\r\nI this case, we have two options:\r\n\r\n- In Woo Blocks, create the compatibility declaration API from scratch. This, I believe, is a bad idea: we will duplicate the same feature, and we will not have a single source of truth!\r\n- Add support for the Cart & Checkout Blocks in the declaring compatibility feature\r\n\r\nWe eventually chose to go with the second solution!\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [3834300886]"}

By default, all attributes are created globally. We inform the user about this in the add attributes modal.\r\n- [ ] Each product option can be edited through a modal, where it will be possible to change the option name, add/remove values, define a default value, and define if it should be displayed to customers  (local vs global): BaoQ3PGPnhAiJCsJtxgej3-fi-102%3A2377&t=EFqwqGcibTmy71Eq-0\r\n- [ ] The first variation in each option is selected by default on the product page. Users can remove it by selecting `None` from the `Default value (optional` dropdown in the option edit modal (in the current experience, we don't have a default value selected, which causes some quirky behaviors). When `None` is selected for all options, no variation will be selected when the user enters the page.\r\n- [ ] Each option should have the box 'Show in product details' unchecked by default.\r\n- [ ] Local attributes are marked with a small info icon. It is displayed in the Attributes and Options lists. When the user hovers over the icon, they will see a tooltip explaining that a local attribute will not be used for filtering, etc.\r\n- [ ] Users can create several global attributes with the same name. We’d generate a unique slug for each based on its name. For example, the slugs for Color and Color would be ‘color’ and ‘color-2’.\r\n- [x] Users need to go to the Attributes screen, to edit the attribute advanced details such as slug or archive.\r\n- [ ] The variation list should be updated if the user adds or removes values. For example, if the user adds a new value to a \"Size\" option, we should auto-create all the new variations based on the new size value.\r\n- [x] When at least one option is created, we should automatically create variations from all options.

If the attribute is added in the options section, the flag will be enabled. There will be no way to enable or disable the flag once the attribute is added. To do that, users need to remove an attribute and add it in a different section: Attributes -> Options or Options -> Attributes.\r\n- [x] If an attribute is added in one section, it can’t be selected in another. Users have to remove it from one section and add it to another. We would detect when an attribute was already added somewhere else and let users move it from one section to another.\r\n- [ ] When users add a global attribute to Attributes, we automatically add its first value. When they add it to Options, we add all of its values.\r\n- [x] Users can select global attributes in both places. If they create new values, they’re added to the attribute but not selected in the products it’s assigned to.\r\n- [ ] Attributes and options can be sorted separately. Options are, by default, hidden from the product description. If the user enables the visibility toggle, options will be displayed below regular attributes.\r\n- [ ] Changing the options order will be reflected at the top of the page and in the product description.\r\n- [ ] If a product has 7 attributes: 2 options and 5 regular attributes, they can move n2 above n1, but not n7 above n2.

{"prompt":"In WooCommerce Payments, we display a task list in Payments > Overview, using [`CollapsibleList`](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/trunk/packages/js/experimental/src/experimental-list/collapsible-list/index.tsx) and [`TaskItem`](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/trunk/packages/js/experimental/src/experimental-list/task-item/index.tsx) from '@woocommerce/experimental' (see [here](https://github.com/Automattic/woocommerce-payments/blob/0b2030b7a99210461f5a3a35b97f9400a3a1654c/client/overview/task-list/index.js#L177-L219));\r\n\r\nWe noticed that the dismiss action from the ellipses menu gets cut off when we open it. The text is not readable and it's impossible to dismiss the task (see the issue raised: https://github.com/Automattic/woocommerce-payments/issues/4470).\r\nThis is only happening when the Gutenberg plugin is also installed. Gutenberg comes with `@wordpress/components` v20.0.0 and WooCommerce Payments bundles v11.1.5, so once Gutenberg is installed, the site is using v20.0.0.\r\n\r\n![Screen Recording 7-21-2022 at 8 45 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5121465/180345688-ef7d402b-499e-4ee1-a438-9a727309f0e8.gif)\r\n\r\nThe same behavior can be observed in the TaskList StoryBook: https://woocommerce.github.io/woocommerce-admin/components/storybook/?path=/story/woocommerce-admin-experimental-list--task-item-example\r\n\r\nIt looks like this is due to a change in how the ellipsis menu is built in `@wordpress/components`. There used to be a `position: fixed` on one of the `<div>` from the ellipsis menu (v11.1.5), and I can see now that it uses `position: absolute`. \r\nAnd the TaskItem defines a class with an `overflow: hidden` rule (see [here](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/ea6a0d31f999a60f99b3625071b860476255629a/plugins/woocommerce-admin/client/tasks/task-list.scss#L2)), which now affects the absolute positioned div from the menu (while it had no effects on it when it was fixed).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28830738/191742281-e796e546-5ce6-4e8f-a271-201730f20c67.png)\r\n\r\nWe may just need to remove the `position: relative` on `woocommerce-experimental-list__item` and move it one level up, to avoid having the absolute div relatively positioned to the element with hidden overflow.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nWhen clicking on the ellipsis menu from a task, we can see the content and dismiss the task.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nWhen clicking on the ellipsis menu from a task, we cannot see the content and dismiss the task.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Go to https://woocommerce.github.io/woocommerce-admin/components/storybook/?path=/story/woocommerce-admin-experimental-list--task-item-example\r\n2.

{"prompt":"undefinedHi,\r\n\r\nThere are lots of cases where a variant can have attributes that differs from the parent, but are not defining the variant. Obvious cases like UPC/EAN/GTIN etc are of course there, but these can be solved with meta data (even though it is kind of not-great for end users).\r\n\r\n### Real life examples\r\n**Life jackets**\r\nLife jackets are typically sized by a interval of heights of the user - \"20 - 30 kg\", \"25 - 40 kg\". By adding `20,21,...30` to the former and `25,26,...40` on an attibute \"Fits weights\" to the latter we can enable a very nice filter on category pages where the customer can pick their weight and see all life jackets that fits them. Since every product has more than one value (20-30 is obviously 10 values) we can not use it for variants. \r\n\r\n**Bike tires**\r\nTires are variantized by it's dimensions (width and height). Wide tires **fits for** mountainbikes, while narrow tires **fits for** racing bikes. To allow customers to (in the category \"Bike tires\") filter by Suitable for (mountainbike|racing bike), we would need to assign that attribute to the variants. If we assign both values to the parent, the filter will be wrong as soon as one of the variants are out of stock (or hidden by any other setting such as visibility, unpublished etc).\r\n\r\nI can go on forever, but I think the uses cases should be clear. Magento and most other platforms have solved this. It would make the PIM part of WooCommerce a great deal more flexible.\r\n\r\nFrom a database perspective, I can not see why this should be very hard to implement. Most of the functionality is actually already there (thanks to the `wp_wc_product_attributes_lookup` table). Since the variants are in fact stored as separate products (posts) it should be fairly straight forward.\r\n\r\nIs there a reason/decision taken why this is not possible? If not, would it be of interest if i tried to take a stab at an implementation?\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [1891051456]"}

{"prompt":"Sometimes plugins use properties of `WP_Screen` to determine what part of the WP Admin they're in so they can, e.g. customize the UI. When the custom order tables are authoritative, we're using a custom admin page to display a list table of orders and the edit UI for single orders, since we can't use the standard screens that assume a post type. However, it seems like we are trying to make the change in UI seamless, even if the URL is different. The `WP_Screen` object for the custom admin pages betrays this though, because some key properties are different:\r\n\r\n**Orders List Table screen**\r\n\r\n| Prop | Posts | Orders |\r\n|--------|--------|--------|\r\n| `base` | `edit` | `woocommerce_page_wc-orders` |\r\n| `id` | `edit-shop_order` | `woocommerce_page_wc-orders` |\r\n| `post_type` | `shop_order` | _empty_ |\r\n\r\n**Single Order screen**\r\n\r\n| Prop | Posts | Orders |\r\n|--------|--------|--------|\r\n| `base` | `post` | `woocommerce_page_wc-orders` |\r\n| `id` | `shop_order` | `woocommerce_page_wc-orders` |\r\n| `post_type` | `shop_order` | _empty_ |\r\n\r\nSo the question is, **would it make sense to try and replicate the screen props on the respective custom admin pages?**\r\n\r\nHere's an example of how `WP_Screen` might be used, where it seems like we should assume that the intended functionality would work regardless of which set of tables is authoritative:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$current_screen = get_current_screen();\r\nif ( 'shop_order' == $current_screen->post_type ) {\r\n\t// Do stuff.\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe it wouldn't make sense to modify the `base` property since it's related to the file name in `wp-admin`.

{"prompt":"I have several WooCommerce stores in which I grant free shipping for orders above $65.\r\n\r\nSo we have two shipping methods:\r\n\r\n- Flat rate at $5 for orders below $65\r\n- Free shipping for orders above $65. This simple structure is not achievable by default on WooCommerce.\r\n\r\n I can set a minimum cart total to qualify for free shipping, but if a customer reaches the threshold, both the free and paid shipping options are displayed, which does not make sense and just confuses the customer, and I have to write a PHP snippet or add a plugin just to remove the paid shipping.\r\n\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nI've considered a few ways to fix this simple issue:\r\n\r\n1. Add a checkbox to the **paid shipping** methods that says \"qualifying for other free shipping methods removes this paid shipping method\" (because sometimes stores want to set up free and paid shipping methods based on cart total, but also a fast premium shipping method that costs money regardless of the cart total). \r\n2. Add a checkbox to the free shipping method that says \"qualifying for this shipping method hides the following shipping methods:\" and the possibility to select one or more shipping methods.\r\n3. Right now, the free shipping method allows to set a minimum cart total to enable it. Why not also allowing to set a maximum cart total to display the paid shipping method? This way, I could set the minimum threshold that qualifies for free shipping, and the maximum threshold that removes paid shipping as an option.\r\n\r\nThere is also a [WooCommerce developer document](https://woocommerce.com/document/hide-other-shipping-methods-when-free-shipping-is-available/) that describes possible solutions with some php snippets, however out there, there are many store managers and merchants who are not developers and this relatively easy-to-fix issue may disincentivize them to use WooCommerce in favor of other platforms.\r\nI would suggest to implement this feature in the core, as it is very easy to do and will not require extensive testing and troubleshooting.\n\n### Additional context\n\nAs you can see from the attached screenshot it doesn't really make sense to give customers a choice between the same shipping service. They will contact customer support asking what the difference is between the two options, slowing down the checkout process.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"369\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-01-28 at 7 06 30 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47855768/215283599-02bcd9f0-b414-495f-bf5b-dbe1dcd6e723.png\">\r\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [1891051459]"}

Specifically, `$this` is not passed, nor anything equivalent (e.g. `$this->get_id()`).\r\n\r\nConsequently, any user of the filter cannot know which customer's taxable address is being examined. It could be any customer on the system.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, the filter should have `$this` added as a parameter, so that code hooking the filter can know *which* customer's address is being requested.\r\n\r\nNote that consequently, any existing code in the world using this filter is likely to be assuming that the customer to be examined is the current customer (i.e. the value of `WC()->customer`) - but that this is a false assumption, since the filter will be called whenever the method is for any customer.\r\n\r\nAs an example, consider this code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$customer = new WC_Customer(123); // Get customer object for user ID 123\r\n\r\n$taxable_address = $customer->get_taxable_address();\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny extension code that has hooked the filter will not know that it's specifically user ID 123 that it is being asked the result for.

{"prompt":"Here is our scenario: We have a federal tax (Canada GST) and a provincial tax (BC PST) set up for our store. People in our province pay both taxes on an order shipped to our province. Occasionally the buyer is PST exempt, so if we enter an order manually in the backend, we delete the PST column from the order and save the order. So long as we don't recalculate the order again, PST will not be charged. We can then send an invoice to the buyer and they pay. No PST. No problem. \r\n\r\nIn the old WC reporting tool, if we report taxes by code on the day that order was made, it shows the correct tax for the order. In the new analytics, if we report taxes for the day the order was made, it does not respect the decision to exempt the PST but instead recalculates the taxes based on the order info (eg shipping address), resulting in an incorrect report of the taxes we've collected!

Alternatively, additional \"hacky\" styles might be used to hide this `<header>` element (e.g. display: none, etc), which leave unwanted HTML markup on the site simply because there's no simple option.\r\n\r\nI think it would be useful to separate this chunk of code into its own template part & output function, and then re-hook it back into the same place, for example on `woocommerce_before_main_content` at priority 40.

It probably should only be implemented in conjunction with that, as explained further below.\r\n\r\nCurrently data items in the analytics cache have a theoretical TTL of [one week](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/35b58245af09042934d9c726786cb3dfcb246838/plugins/woocommerce/src/Admin/API/Reports/Cache.php#L73). However, any time a relevant entity (order, product, coupon, etc.) changes or is created, the entire cache [gets invalidated](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/35b58245af09042934d9c726786cb3dfcb246838/plugins/woocommerce/src/Admin/API/Reports/Cache.php#L25), so it seems unlikely on an active store that a cache item would ever reach end-of-life. On medium/high traffic stores, this essentially means that analytics requests will never return cached data, and will always end up running expensive, slow queries.\r\n\r\nTo mitigate this, I propose that we make two changes (plus the change in #33221):\r\n\r\n* Change the way that the cache version value ([a second-based Unix timestamp](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/35b58245af09042934d9c726786cb3dfcb246838/plugins/woocommerce/includes/class-wc-cache-helper.php#L258)) is generated to round to a particular increment, say, 10 minutes. This would mean that several entity changes clustered together, or a high rate of continuous changes, would only cause one invalidation every 10 minutes.\r\n* Change the existing TTL from one week down to one day, or even one hour. This way, if changes happen _after_ an invalidation but still within the same 10-minute window, the data would not remain stale for very long.\r\n\r\nThe benefit of combining these changes with #33221 is that if a user notices stale data, they would be able to send an API request to immediately refresh the cache for that particular data set, rather than having to wait for the cache to expire. In the mobile apps, this would manifest as doing a \"pull to refresh\".\r\n\r\nThe tricky part, I think, is figuring out the best balance between cache version increment and TTL to most benefit stores, regardless of their rate of activity.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n* We could simply turn off cache invalidation altogether and rely on a low TTL. I think this would be harder to balance between high/low activity stores, with only one lever to move instead of two.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\np91TBi-8Ro-p2\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [2258932484,3943425133]"}

{"prompt":"Under particular tax configurations, in combination with a coupon, the `line_items` in the `/orders/` and `/orders/{id}/` responses have excessively precision on fields such as `price`. This has led to issues refunding orders in the mobile apps based on these values, as often they are slightly higher than the order total.\r\n\r\nThese fields are more currency-like when the settings are different, or when no coupon is applied to the order.

{"prompt":"undefinedAs you develop your new tables, I urge you to read up on MySQL InnoDB clustered indexes. \r\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-index-types.html\r\n\r\n In InnoDB, the whole table's data is stored behind the primary key. There's no separate table data structure. So, you can make the tables more performant by building a composite primary key that can be used to satisfy your most common, or your worst-performing, queries.  \r\n\r\nPrimary Keys serve two purposes.\r\n\r\n1. they uniquely identify the rows of the table. That's why many tables use the autoincrementing ID as the PK.\r\n\r\n2. they provide rapid access to the table: WHERE filters that use the PK have immediate access to the table's data, but filters using other indexes must then look up the data using the PK.   This purpose of PKs is a solid part of RDBMS technology, but often not used. It's used by making the PK into a multicolumn index.\r\n\r\nFor example, on wp_wc_orders. You might define  the PRIMARY KEY as `(post_id, status, id)` rather than just `(id)`. That choice of columns means lookup patterns like\r\n\r\n            SELECT * FROM wp_wc_orders WHERE post_id = ? AND status = 'pending'\r\n            SELECT * FROM wp_wc_orders WHERE post_id = ?\r\n\r\nwould get rapid access via the PK for that query pattern. You'll have to choose the the actual PK based on your actual query patterns if you adopt this suggestion.\r\n\r\nIf your most common access filter pattern were `SELECT * FROM wp_wc_orders WHERE status = 'pending'` you'd flip the order of the columns in the PK to  `(status, post_id, id)`  \r\n\r\nThe inclusion of id as the last column in the composite guarantees the PK's uniqueness.\r\n\r\nTo make the autoincrementing id work correctly, you'll also have to put a UNIQUE KEY id (id) on the table. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nI've been proving out this concept with https://wordpress.org/plugins/index-wp-mysql-for-speed/\r\n\r\nThe writeup about the keys is here.  https://www.plumislandmedia.net/index-wp-mysql-for-speed/tables_and_keys/\r\n\r\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [3834300886]"}

{"prompt":"### Context\r\nWhen editing an order, I was able to add several download product permissions for the same downloadable product. I checked the title and download url were exactly the same in all these duplicated downloadable product permissions, and this looks superfluous to me.\r\n\r\nI can see the point of letting users add multiple download permissions for the same product in the same order. \r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\n - If the number of downloads limit has been exceeded and merchants want to add more, they can just add another permission with another number of downloads.\r\n - If the download has expired, merchants can add another permission with another expiration date.\r\n\r\nDrawbacks:\r\n- Merchants need to have under control all the order's downloadable product permissions, because if there are multiple permissions for the same product in the same order, they might clash and cause unexpected behaviours. Keeping this situation under control when you have several downloadable products in the same order - each one with several permissions - could be messy.\r\n\r\nThere is a way of keeping these benefits and removing the drawback.\r\n\r\n### Improvement suggestion\r\nWe could restrict merchants to add only **one** downloadable product permission for the same product in the same order. This way they just need to **update** the permission's number of downloads or the expiration date to extend the download capability and cover the benefits mentioned above. Also, this way, the drawback exposed earlier would be removed, as there wouldn't be any place for multiple downloadable product permissions for the same product in the same order.\r\n\r\n### Priority\r\nThings just work right now, so I'd say this could be a medium-low priority enhancement.

{"prompt":"For every WooCommerce REST API request using a WooCommerce API key, the key's last access time (stored in the database field `wp_woocommerce_api_keys.last_access`) gets updated 10 times.  This is obviously sub-optimal for performance.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect the last access time to be updated only once (with one single SQL `UPDATE` query) per API request.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe last access time gets updated 10 times (with 10 separate SQL `UPDATE` queries) per API request.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. First, I recommend using Firefox for testing this since it's going to be necessary to make REST API calls in a web browser and Firefox automatically formats JSON to make viewing much easier.  So you should start by logging in to WordPress with an Administrator account using Firefox.\r\n\r\n2. In the WordPress admin section, click \"WooCommerce\", then \"Settings\".  Click the \"Advanced\" tab and then \"REST API\".\r\n\r\n3. Click the \"Add key\" button to create a new API key.  Enter anything in the \"Description\" field; the \"User\" field should be pre-filled with your (Administrator) user account. For \"Permissions\", read-only access will be enough for testing purposes.  Click \"Generate API key\".  Copy the \"Consumer key\" and \"Consumer secret\" values and record them somewhere for future use.\r\n\r\n4. Install the [Query Monitor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/query-monitor/) plugin.  We will use this for [analyzing REST API requests](https://querymonitor.com/blog/2021/05/debugging-wordpress-rest-api-requests/).\r\n\r\n5. In your web browser (while you are still logged in as WordPress administrator - you need to be logged in for Query Monitor to work), visit the following URL:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://example.com/path/to/wordpress/wp-json/wc/v3?consumer_key=ck_...&consumer_secret=cs_...&_envelope\r\n```\r\n\r\nChange `example.com`, `/path/to/wordpress`, `ck_...` and `cs_...` to match your site's URL and the API credentials you generated in step 3.  You should NOT change `https://` to `http://` because the REST API requires SSL to work.  If you only have an `http://` URL set up, as a quick hack you can edit your `wp-config.php` and add `$_SERVER['HTTPS'] = 'on';` somewhere before the \"stop editing\" line.  This will trick WordPress and WooCommerce into thinking that the site is being served over SSL, which is sufficient for testing the REST API.\r\n\r\nIn the JSON output you should see a `qm` key.  The duplicate SQL queries are under `qm.db_queries.dupes.queries`.  This should contain a query which looks something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUPDATE wp_woocommerce_api_keys SET last_access = '2021-12-25 04:14:03' WHERE key_id = 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your server is slow you might see some queries with one timestamp and other queries with a timestamp one second later, etc.  If your server is incredibly slow - suppose that it takes 10 seconds or more to handle the API request - then it's theoretically possible that you might not see any duplicate queries because each query could get a different timestamp.  But if your server handles the API request in a reasonable time (less than 10 seconds), you should see the duplicate queries there.\r\n\r\n![screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1156399/147377290-e521adf7-c2c9-47e2-9690-f69249703973.png)\r\n\r\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [2258932484,472334370]"}

{"prompt":"**Just some brief context**, the following bug occurred during the project WooCommerce Store Editing Templates where we are converting WC Core PHP templates into Block Templates (https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/issues/4926). For V1 we essentially rendered the entire template as a single block represented as a placeholder within the editor (see screenshot below).\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2021-12-11 at 09 44 40](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8639742/145672110-c0bc8e85-6391-466d-9bd8-f7c4facadaf0.png)\r\n\r\n**The Bug**\r\n\r\nDuring this project we found that users were unable to add variable products to their cart. The cause of this bug was because the code that [enqueues the required scripts](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/trunk/plugins/woocommerce/includes/wc-template-functions.php#L1710) is running _before_ the code that [registers the required scripts](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/trunk/plugins/woocommerce/includes/class-wc-frontend-scripts.php#L169).\r\n\r\nThis is only an issue for block templates because we are getting the block template html by running `get_the_block_template_html` which enqueues the required scripts, before we run `wp_head()`, which registers the required scripts [here](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/master/wp-includes/template-canvas.php#L12). Resulting in a scenario where we are trying to enqueue scripts before they are registered, meaning they don't get included on the frontend.\r\n\r\nWe were able to implement a fix which meant running the `load_scripts()` method in our block template code, you can see the PR for this [here](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-gutenberg-products-block/pull/5346). I am wondering if there is a better way to solve this problem upstream rather than patching it downstream in our template code.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nVariable products get added to the users cart\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nAdding variable products to the cart returns an error, and they do not get added.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n* Install WooCommerce 6.0.0 (inc beta) or greater.\r\n* Install Woo Blocks. If the fix linked above is included in your Woo Blocks build please comment this out.\r\n* Install and activate Gutenberg plugin and a block theme such as TT1.\r\n* Load variable product on the frontend and try add it to the cart.\r\n* Observe error.\n\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [33006876]"}

I think a fix for this situation would be bringing the routine into a cron or Action Scheduler job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n<!-- Describe the steps to reproduce the behavior.-->\r\n\r\nNot yet available.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior:\r\n\r\nThe resulting fatal error causes WordPress to send an email to the site owner with the stacktrace.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nGraceful handling and logging of the error instead of fatal error.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nOriginal zendesk issue: 4553364-zd-woothemes \r\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [3943104021]"}

{"prompt":"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when […] -->\r\nWhen developing Google Listings and Ads plugin. We have a number of button links: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17435/135122371-f6b67c02-d599-43f5-b9e7-ad49aad55d2c.png)\r\nWe use [`@wordpress/components.Button`](https://wordpress.github.io/gutenberg/?path=/story/components-button--secondary), to achieve the look, to make it an accessible link, we just set the `href` component - easy and convenient.\r\n```jsx\r\nimport { Button } from '@wordpress/components';\r\nimport { getNewPath } from '@woocommerce/navigation';\r\n// …\r\n<Button isSecondary\thref={ getNewPath( null, '/google/settings' ) } >Edit</Button>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it does the full page reload and does not use WC SPA feature.\r\n\r\nIn few places we tried making some use of `@woocommerce/components.Link` element:\r\n```jsx\r\nimport { Button } from '@wordpress/components';\r\nimport { Link } from '@woocommerce/components';\r\nimport { getNewPath } from '@woocommerce/navigation';\r\n// …\r\n<Link href={ getNewPath( null, '/google/settings' ) }><Button isSecondary href={ getNewPath( null, '/google/settings' ) } >Edit</Button></Link>\r\n```\r\nWhich uses the Woo navigation features, and looks good at the first sight.\r\n\r\nBut it has a few drawbacks:\r\n- :red_circle:  A11Y is impaired, as the screenreader finds it as \"Edit, button\", instead of \"Edit, visited link\"\r\n- :red_circle:  It produces invalid HTML `<a><button>`\r\n- :factory_worker: Requires additional, fragile CSS workarounds\r\n- :nail_care: HTML markup is a bit redundant `<Link><KindaLink>`\r\n- :nail_care: :crystal_ball:  We may loose any features of WP.Button, for link buttons, like specific stling for visited button links, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nSo we need to choose either:\r\n- impaired experience for everybody, or\r\n- impaired experience, for people using assistive technology\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->\r\nI'd like to be able to use an accessible link button, without compromising UX.\r\n\r\nI was thinking of two solutions:\r\n1. Make `@woocommerce/components` proxy `@wordpress/~` Buttons, adding the [`wc-admin` type handler](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-admin/blob/main/packages/components/src/link/index.js#L47-L49).\r\n\t- + This could help cover other issues related to WC vs WP Links, like woocommerce/woocommerce#32236\r\n\t- - Requires significant implementation and maintenance effort.\r\n2. Let the `Link` module export its intercepting logic, in the form of \r\n\t- component hook (p7H4VZ-2IH-p2, @diegohaz is that the applicable use-case?)\r\n\t- more composable component\r\n\t- or just a bare function, that a consuming developer, could use to attach `onClick` to WP or any other component.\r\n\tBasically, export https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-admin/blob/main/packages/components/src/link/index.js#L18-L40\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\r\nWe could also think of a more sophisticated way to intercept any navigation on the DOM, or history API level. So any link pointing to a location within wc-admin would use SPA flow. With opt-in or opt-out strategy.\r\n\r\n(For example, In my previous Web Components based project, we had a solution, that was intercepting all navigation, then was finding the originating `<a>` element (even in shadow/composed events), checking if it was within a scope/subtree of a specific custom element, let's call it `<wc-page>` for our case, and without opt-out via an attribute or another component. Then it was either doing page morph, or letting the default behavior)\r\n\r\n### Should this be prioritized? Why?\r\nI believe the longest we have this uncovered, the more workarounds will popup in the plugins, effectively increasing the global maintenance cost for A8C and 3PDs.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n<!--Any additional context, screenshots, or details you think might be helpful.-->\r\n- The problem sparked to me at https://github.com/woocommerce/google-listings-and-ads/pull/1025#discussion_r717329726\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [3943104021,3943425720,3943425968,702347761]"}

{"prompt":"### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\r\nAs a plugin developer, I'd like to use `@woocommerce/components` and `@wordpress/components` to build consistent UI and UX. Also, I'd like to know which elements should I use for what.\r\n\r\n#### TL;DR\r\nThere are [WC`<Link type=\"external\">`](https://woocommerce.github.io/woocommerce-admin/#/components/) and [WP`<ExternalLink>`](https://wordpress.github.io/gutenberg/?path=/docs/components-externallink--default), which seems to serve a similar purpose, but look different.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17435/131871674-0fd4be6b-4701-4396-8633-ee830c44bdbc.png)\r\nIs that a conscious design decision? Which one should we use in WC?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Long story\r\nIf I find a `Woocommerce/` element I assume, I should use it as it's more WooCommerce-specialized.\r\nSo, in Google Listings and Ads plugin we started to use [`@woocommerce/components.Link`](https://woocommerce.github.io/woocommerce-admin/#/components/). Then, in few places, when the links were pointing to external domains, we added `type=\"external\"`. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17435/131871250-7335eeb9-c784-45fd-bc83-f00c79705e49.png)\r\n\r\nIt does not have a visual indicator that we wanted to have in our UI so we and added `<ExtarnalIcon>` and styled it.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17435/131871285-f11429a2-8a41-41d3-8ced-6a59b61c6db0.png)\r\n\r\nBut then we realized, there is an [`@wordpress/components.ExternalLink`](https://wordpress.github.io/gutenberg/?path=/docs/components-externallink--default)\r\nThat has it build in, and aligned better.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17435/131872109-c0caf4d3-3935-4ce2-a5ed-dfd590cdcdfd.png)\r\n\r\nNow we are pretty confused.\r\n1. Should we stick to WC`<Link type=\"external\">`, as it was a conscious design decision not to have a visual indication for external links?\r\n2. Should we use WP`<ExternalLink>`, as WooCommerce's `type=\"external\"` has a different purpose?\r\n3. Should I make a PR to use WP`<ExternalLink>` in WC`<Link>`, as that's something that was missed\r\n4. Should I make a plugin-specific version of WC`<Link>`, if I want to have a visual indicator, as wc-admin does not want that, but it's OK for other plugins to use it?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nI'd prefer 3. from above:\r\nMake `<Link type=\"external\">` use WordPress's `<ExternalLink>` inside, so the merchant would get a visual indication, to expect when they will get redirected away. But also get the consistent UI across WP, WC and my plugin.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n1,2,4 from above.\r\n\r\n### Should this be prioritized? Why?\r\nNo big rush, as nothing is fundamentally broken, just UI and UX is inconsistent.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n- Google Listings and Ads issue - https://github.com/woocommerce/google-listings-and-ads/issues/984\r\n- an example of desired use \r\n\t![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17435/131873850-5aa08fde-ebbc-49e7-bca2-162dd64800cf.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n//cc  @j111q \r\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [3943104021,3943425720]"}

{"prompt":"This problem was originally noted in a WooCommerce payments issue\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Automattic/woocommerce-payments/issues/2269 \r\n\r\nHowever, the problem lies with the underlying search component component. This component is used through out the analytics experience, as well as through out the merchant dashboard of WooCommerce Payments. \r\n\r\n**Problems with the current UX**\r\n\r\nThe search component supports multiple strings. Each time you enter a new string, it's wrapped in a pill with its own X button to remove it from the search query. Additionally the search field has its own X button that will clear all search strings from the field. This creates a bit of visual confusion with all of the X floating around. Even after you add a string, the helper text reappears. If there are only one or two strings, on a desktop viewport this isn't very problematic, however, on smaller screens or with many or long search strings, the preview text overflows the container. The X button to clear the strings is easily lost in the text. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1873\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-08-25 at 1 37 39 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4500952/130895276-7bea6b62-e486-4f7a-8a85-403106fdd1f0.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nThe component doesn't scale well to mobile devices, currently the strings are wrapping to two or more lines and blowing out of the field. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"421\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-08-25 at 8 14 43 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4500952/130895561-e2b845a1-e654-4e8d-9e11-8dc8dadc4cf2.png\">\r\n\r\nImprovements to the UX: \r\n\r\n<img width=\"925\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-08-25 at 8 38 16 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4500952/130896680-5de99ab3-029b-4779-9283-dd3c0352fa12.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Helper text is only visible when there are no strings added to the search query. The helper text disappears as soon as the the merchant begins to type the first string. \r\n2. We replace the X button on the field with a less ambiguous \"Clear all\" interaction. Clear all only appears after two or more strings are added to the field. \r\n3. instead of wrapping, search strings should overflow the container and be hidden from view. The field should scroll horizontally. As strings are added, the latest string should always be in view, scrolling any previous strings out of view on the left side of the field. I don't think wrapping is a viable option since in most (all) places we're using this component, the vertical height of the field is limited by the content that surrounds it.\r\n4. Both the search icon and \"Clear all\" components should have solid white backgrounds with slight gradients, so that overflowing search strings fade smoothly out as they reach the end of the container and flow under these elements. \r\n\r\nYou can use[ this prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/7slT5vNKNLqoW078P77RqB/WC-Admin-Search?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=2%3A12&viewport=472%2C48%2C0.7&scaling=min-zoom) to preview the overflow UI. \r\n\r\n\r\ncc @elizaan36 @pmcpinto @Mayisha \n\n###\n\n","completion":" [3943104021,3943425720]"}

This makes it impossible for sites to listen for the `applied_coupon_in_checkout` event in JavaScript and conditionally do something based on whether a coupon was successfully applied as the event is triggered so long as there is a notice in the response and the event data only contains the user-supplied coupon code.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nOne of:\r\n\r\n- The `applied_coupon_in_checkout` JavaScript event (and probably other JavaScript events) include enough context for developers to work out whether an action succeeded or failed, or the event to only be triggered contextually based on success or fail state\r\n- The `WC_AJAX::apply_coupon()` PHP method configure the HTTP response in a way to indicate whether coupons were successfully applied to the cart (whether it be by including additional data beyond a HTML snippet or changing the status code, doesn't necessarily matter here)\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\nThe `applied_coupon_in_checkout` JavaScript event is always triggered as long as the server emits a 200 response (which, it should short of a fatal error it appears) and the server response and JavaScript event lack context to decide whether a coupon was actually applied.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the bug (We need to be able to reproduce the bug in order to fix it.)**\r\nSteps to reproduce the bug:\r\n1. Create a coupon in the WooCommerce plugin admin\r\n2. From the WordPress frontend, add any product to your cart and go to the checkout screen\r\n3. Open your browser's developer console to be able to inspect the responses from the upcoming AJAX calls\r\n4. Click the \"Have a coupon? Click here to enter your code\" message to show the coupon code form\r\n5. Enter in your coupon and apply it, note that the AJAX call to the `?wc-ajax=apply_coupon` endpoint returns a 200 response with the HTML for the notice shown on the screen\r\n6. Try to apply the same coupon again, note that the AJAX call to the `?wc-ajax=apply_coupon` endpoint returns a 200 response with the HTML for the notice shown on the screen\r\n7.

Install and activate [this plugin](https://github.com/woocommerce/action-scheduler-disable-default-runner) to temporarily disable scheduled actions.\r\n2. Go to WooCommerce &rarr; Settings &rarr; Advanced &rarr; Webhooks.  Create a new webhook with Name = \"Test\", Status = \"Active\", Topic = \"Product updated\", Delivery URL = `https://example.com/` (it doesn't really matter what the URL is, we are going to be deleting this before the webhook is delivered anyway).\r\n3. Go to the \"Products\" page and edit a product.  This will trigger the webhook.\r\n4. Go to WooCommerce &rarr; Status &rarr; Scheduled Actions.  Click \"Pending\".  You should see a scheduled action with hook `woocommerce_deliver_webhook_async`.  (Because scheduled actions were disabled in step 1, this action should remain \"Pending\" indefinitely without manual intervention.)\r\n5. Go back to the \"Webhooks\" page, look for the webhook you created in step 2, and click \"Delete permanently\".\r\n6. Go back to the \"Scheduled Actions\" page and view the \"Pending\" webhooks again.  The `woocommerce_deliver_webhook_async` scheduled action should still be there (remember that scheduled actions were disabled in step 1).  Click \"Run\" to execute it manually.  The page should display the message: \"Successfully executed action: `woocommerce_deliver_webhook_async`\".\r\n7. Go back to the \"Webhooks\" page.

The legacy reports maintains and displays the old, deleted tax rate name in the chart. Importing Historical Data does not fix.\r\n\r\nI looked at the orders in question in the database and they indeed had the tax rate from the deleted rates. I modified the record in the database to use the current tax rate identifier and now the orders show in the chart as they should, but use the new tax rate name instead of the old one. The old identifier name still appears in the legacy chart fyi.\r\n\r\nFYI, I was requested to open a bug ticket here by the WC Support Forum staff..\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nWe should see all tax rate line items in the new WC/Taxes chart regardless if a tax rate has been modified in the WC Taxes settings. This is the behavior that we see in the old WC Tax Reports chart.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\nWhen a tax rate in WC/Settings/Taxes is removed the Analytics/Taxes does not show the Tax Rate i the chart. The old WC Tax Report DOES show it.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the bug (We need to be able to reproduce the bug in order to fix it.)**\r\nSteps to reproduce the bug:\r\n\r\n1. Create a standard tax rate with a unique name.\r\n2. Place an order using that tax rate\r\n3. Complete the order (mark as completed/shipped)\r\n4. Delete the standard tax rate\r\n5. Add the same tax rate back in but with a new name.\r\n\r\nYou should see that in the legacy reports the old tax rate shows in the report.

However, I'd prefer to have it consistent across all props, and preferably, not too verbose.\r\n\r\n### **Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nI was thinking of all props together like:\r\n1. a curated list of props\r\n\t  ```js\r\n\t  searchProps: PropTypes.shape( {\r\n\t\t    placeholder: PropTypes.string,\r\n\t\t    type: PropTypes.string.isRequired,\r\n\t\t    autocompleter: PropTypes.object,\r\n\t  } ),\r\n\t  ```\r\n2. or a transparent props obj, that we will simply forward (and extend where needed)\r\n\t  ```js\r\n\t  searchProps: Search.propTypes\r\n\t  ```\r\n\r\n### **Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nWe could also keep the props list flat as today:\r\n```js\r\nsearchPlaceholder: PropTypes.string,\r\nsearchType: PropTypes.string.isRequired,\r\nsearchAutocompleter: PropTypes.object,\r\n```\r\nBut I find it verbose, and we already have a precedent of non-flat prop - `labels`\r\n\r\n### **Should this be prioritized?

{"prompt":"I am trying to: Give clients outside EU the view of prices excl. tax, and clients within EU incl. tax\r\n\r\nI expected to see: If a client is registered, or has set the address on checkout that is outside EU the prices should show without VAT. This works as intended.\r\n\r\nInstead, I got: It also makes everyone else to see prices on VARIABLE PRODUCTS without VAT regardless if they are from EU or not.\r\n\r\nAfter extensive testing and troubleshooting it turns out woocommerce make use of transients to fetch the price information and thus displaying the prices on the variable products incorrectly store-wide after a visitor from OUTSIDE EU adds their delivery address to the checkout page. Single products works ok as far as we have been testing this issue.\r\n\r\nI have setup a clean WP/WC (Storefront theme) staging to confirm this bug is not theme related, and I am able to reproduce this issue there.\r\n\r\nTemporary correction of product prices: Edit a variable product, save it (without making any changes). This restores the correct prices incl.tax untill next visitor from outside EU comes to play.\r\n\r\nSteps on how to reproduce the error:\r\n\r\n1. Browse the site in incognito mode to view the correct product prices. All the products are set to display 10€ (incl. tax)\r\n\r\n2. Add the variable product hoodie-with-logo-copy/ to the cart and head to checkout page.\r\n\r\n3. You can use this address for delivery and activate the 0% tax that has been configured for clients from Norway:\r\nStreet: Storgatan 5\r\nZIP: 4010\r\nCity: Stavanger\r\nCountry: Norway\r\n\r\n4. Complete checkout and return to main page. Verify all the simple product prices are now displayed without VAT and the variable product incorrectly with VAT.\r\n\r\n5. Close the incognito window, and open a new incognito window.\r\n\r\n6. You will notice that all the single product prices are OK (with vat), and the Variable item ‘Hoodie with OPTIONS’ is showing the price without VAT. This is the bug.\r\n\r\nImportant step on testing is also to close the incognito window after one test, and open a whole new incognito window to verify results. Simply opening a new tab on incognito mode does not always work.\r\n\r\nRegarding geolocation – MaxMind is active & license added (just like on the live environment) The display of taxes however has been set to assign the taxes on checkout page based on the client shipping address.\r\n\r\nFor testing the view with VAT you can use this address:\r\n\r\nStreet: Hämeentie 11\r\nZip: 00530\r\nCity: Helsinki\r\nCountry: Finland\r\n\r\nOne further clarification to avoid any misunderstandings:\r\n\r\nHow the prices should be displayed:\r\nNorway = VAT 0% (Not a EU member state)\r\nFinland = VAT 24%\r\nSweden = VAT 24%\r\n\r\nBut also please note: The main issue is displaying prices without VAT for new customers entering the site (before adding an address), once there has been customers browsing the site eligible to view prices without VAT… Default should always be to display prices with VAT.\r\n\r\nInitially I thought this might be an issue with WPML, and the support thread with their support can be seen here: https://wpml.org/forums/topic/tax-is-displayed-incorrect-on-variable-product-prices-on-multilingual-site/\r\n\r\nAccording to their conclusions the issue however lies in WooCommerce itself.\r\n\r\nthe problematic transient is _transient_wc_var_prices_740\r\nThis transient is stored based on the user session, so it could be that something from woocommerce_sessions table or a custom config is causing this behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe sandbox site is a clean install with only WP+WC installed without any customisations made.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [1891051437]"}
{"prompt":"I have a very specific issue where a third-party plugin feeds WooCommerce with dynamic coupons using the `woocommerce_get_shop_coupon_data` hook in the constructor of _WC_Coupon_.

This function will not set post meta field values to the _WC_Coupon_ object. I documented [my issue at StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67440898/how-to-append-meta-data-to-a-third-party-coupon-dynamically) in detail.\r\n\r\nI was also looking for a bypass to circumvent this issue, but WooCommerce seems to re-use the coupons by passing the string of the code to a new _WC_Coupon_ instance over and over, again. This makes it impossible for me to modify the post meta field reliably, so some other logic is triggered from another plugin of which I have no control.\r\n\r\nAfter all, post meta fields for dynamic coupons are not load from the database, so storing any fields in the database has no effect.\r\n\r\nEventually, the third-party plugin provided a hook for us to bypass this limitation, but I think it would be nice in general to be able to set post meta field on dynamic coupons.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [1891051442]"}

{"prompt":"**Prerequisites (mark completed items with an [x]):**\r\n- [x] I have have carried out troubleshooting steps and I believe I have found a bug.\r\n- [x] I have searched for similar bugs in both open and closed issues and cannot find a duplicate.\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nI believe the function `WC_Product_Importer::get_percentage_complete` incorrectly overestimates the completion of the product import progress. In particular it may report a progress of `100` even though the import has not read the entire file yet.\r\nThis causes early termination of the import process due to `WC_Product_Importer::do_ajax_product_import` checking if `get_percentage_complete() === 100` to determine whether the import has completed. As a direct result, the final lines in a CSV file are, in some cases, skipped during the import process. This problem may also occur in other places, however I have not verified it.\r\n \r\nThe root of this behaviour is the use of `NumberUtil::round` when calculating the percentage, since it may round up to `100`. https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/b19500728b4b292562afb65eb3a0c0f50d5859de/includes/import/abstract-wc-product-importer.php#L163\r\n\r\nBelow is the snippet from `WC_Product_Importer::do_ajax_product_import` in which the return value is checked against `100`.\r\nhttps://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/b19500728b4b292562afb65eb3a0c0f50d5859de/includes/admin/class-wc-admin-importers.php#L236-L241\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n`WC_Product_Importer::get_percentage_complete` should return `100` if and only if `$this->file_position === $size`.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\n`WC_Product_Importer::get_percentage_complete` returns `100` if e.g. `$this->file_position === 995` and `$size === 1000`.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the bug**\r\nI have created a CSV file that, when imported, triggers the aforementioned bug. You can find it [here](https://pastebin.com/uMVnxGzy).\r\n1. Go to `/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=product&page=product_importer`\r\n2.

{"prompt":"**Prerequisites (mark completed items with an [x]):**\r\n- [x] I have have carried out troubleshooting steps and I believe I have found a bug.\r\n- [x] I have searched for similar bugs in both open and closed issues and cannot find a duplicate.\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen making an export of products, a Variable Product that is set to `Draft` will have value `-1` in its \"Published\" column.\r\nIt's children will also have this same value.\r\n\r\nWhen making an import however, it will only consider status `0` or `1` for the children. As a result, the product will be imported, it will have a `Draft` status, but the variations do not show.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe status code `-1` (for `Draft`) for children/variations should apply for both **imports** and **exports**.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\nThe status code `-1` (for `Draft`) for children/variations only applies for **exports**. \r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the bug (We need to be able to reproduce the bug in order to fix it.)**\r\nSteps to reproduce the bug:\r\n1. Create a Variable Product with a number of variations and set it to `Draft`.\r\n2. Go to Products → Export and make an export of this Variable Product.\r\n3. Open the CSV and observe that both the parent, and its variations, all have status `-1`.\r\n4. Delete the Variable Product (also remove it from Trash) and import the CSV -- or import the CSV into another site.\r\n5. The Variable Product exists, but it does not show any variations.\r\n\r\n**Additional details**\r\nUntil a few months ago, it was normal that variations/children could only have status `0` or `1`. Only the **parent** could have status `-1` (ref: https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/issues/27308#issuecomment-673516931 ).\r\n\r\nThis was changed in PR #27046, where the status of children/variations would always follow the status of the parent, so now, children/variations would have status `-1` as well in the CSV file after an export.\r\n\r\nBut imports would then ignore this status, as it would only consider `0` or `1` as a valid status for a child/variation.\r\n\r\nFor consistency, I suggest one of the two fixes:\r\n\r\n- For **exports**, a Variable Product in `Draft` mode should have `-1` for the parent, and `1` for the children.\r\n\r\n*- OR -* \r\n\r\n- For **imports**, the status of the children of a Variable Product should be ignored or considered `1`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Isolating the problem (mark completed items with an [x]):**\r\n- [x] I have deactivated other plugins and confirmed this bug occurs when only WooCommerce plugin is active.\r\n- [x] This bug happens with a default WordPress theme active, or [Storefront](https://woocommerce.com/storefront/).\r\n- [x] I can reproduce this bug consistently using the steps above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [1891051456]"}

While Cart, Checkout, and My Account simply create regular pages that contain WC shortcodes for embedding the specific functionalities, Shop and single product pages instead use WC’s built-in templates rather than leverage the active theme’s parts or checking for theme-specific part existence and falling back to built-in if missing, and do not leverage its existing theme-checking functionality to more closely replicate what the default themes actually do for theme template parts and such.\r\n\r\nUsing a default theme like Twenty Twenty, the result is some content (all non-WC and some WC) with proper loading of Twenty Twenty’s theme parts and some content (only WC) only loading Twenty Twenty’s header (`get_header`) and footer (`get_footer`) without realizing that Twenty Twenty puts its footer widgets and menu loading (`get_template_part( 'template-parts/footer-menus-widgets' )`) in the page templates, index.php, and singular.php, rather than in footer.php . Twenty Twenty’s index.php in particular also tries to load multiple other template parts that WC’s shop page template doesn’t account for. The Shop page in particular also no longer has the Template dropdown option in the Page Attributes meta box even though Twenty Twenty is still the active theme, but this portion of the bug will be filed separately as I haven't yet figured out where in WC's system to suggest adding back in the Template support.\r\n\r\nI found that WC has basic functionality in place to check if a default theme is active, but as far as I can tell none of it is used in WC-specific templates to conditionally include theme-specific parts that are outside `header.php` and `footer.php` . Admittedly, it looks like Twenty Twenty seems to be the first default theme that has these theme parts loaded directly in the page templates rather than rolled into header or footer, and I haven't yet checked if Twenty Twenty One does the same thing or not.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nWith a default theme such as Twenty Twenty active, all pages (both WC-controlled and non-WC controlled) properly load all template parts of the theme without needing to create theme-specific copies of WC's templates,\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\nBecause some theme parts are not rolled into Twenty Twenty's header or footer, theme parts such as the footer widgets section do not get loaded on pages like Shop or item details with WC-controlled templates.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the bug (We need to be able to reproduce the bug in order to fix it.)**\r\nSteps to reproduce the bug:\r\n1. Activate a default theme such as Twenty Twenty or a child theme of such that doesn't have copies of WC-specific templates.\r\n2. Activate WooCommerce and either assign an existing page as the Shop page or create a new one for such. Optionally, publish shop items as well.\r\n3. Populate any footer widgets sidebar with any valid widget.\r\n4. Visit the site as normal and see that the Shop page as well as any item detail pages do not load the footer widgets theme part.\r\n\r\n**Isolating the problem (mark completed items with an [x]):**\r\n- [x] I have deactivated other plugins and confirmed this bug occurs when only WooCommerce plugin is active.\r\n- [x] This bug happens with a default WordPress theme active, or [Storefront](https://woocommerce.com/storefront/).\r\n- [x] I can reproduce this bug consistently using the steps above.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Solution**\r\nRight now, as a workaround the active child theme has two WC template overrides, `single-product.php` and `archive-product.php` , with only one line added each before `get_footer` to load the missing footer widgets theme part. Ultimately, these additions (simply the addition of `get_template_part( 'template-parts/footer-menus-widgets' );` right before `get_footer('shop');` in each of the templates) should be in the vanilla WC templates inside a conditional to check if the active theme is a default theme such as Twenty Twenty or a child of such. The default theme Twenty Twenty One may or may not also load theme template parts in a similar fashion, but I haven't yet personally checked to confirm.\r\n\r\n**WordPress Environment**\r\nNote: the active child theme has two WC template overrides, `single-product.php` and `archive-product.php` , with only one line added each before `get_footer` to load the missing footer widgets theme part.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [1891051454,1891051461]"}

{"prompt":"**Prerequisites (mark completed items with an [x]):**\r\n- [x] I have carried out troubleshooting steps and I believe I have found a bug.\r\n- [x] I have searched for similar bugs in both open and closed issues and cannot find a duplicate.\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nIn some circumstances, when simply saving the order from the WooCommerce backend, the order amount values get changed.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nWhen saving an order, amounts shouldn't be changed arbitrarily.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\nThe order total gets changed when simply saving the order (when some specific values are present).\r\nThis occurred on a production site but it can be reproduced on a vanilla WP with WooCommerce being the only plugin installed and with a default theme.\r\nAt first, I couldn't believe my eyes, but after further investigation, I found that the described bug depends on the presence of some very small float number in the `line_tax` fields that can be present after applying taxes and discounts. These values are rendered in the order edit form with the scientific notation (i.e. -8,0E-5). They appear as 0,00€ visually in the order table, but the hidden input gets the value in the scientific notation. When the form is submitted, those values are interpreted as integers, so i.e. \r\n-8,0E-5€ becomes -8€, and it changes also the total of the order.\r\nThis is caused by the `wc_format_localized_price` function, which internally uses the `strval` function, which can return strings with numbers in scientific notation (i.e. 0.00008 becomes -8.0E-5).\r\n\r\nThis is the current implementation of that function:\r\n```\r\nfunction wc_format_localized_price( $value ) {\r\n\treturn apply_filters( 'woocommerce_format_localized_price', str_replace( '.', wc_get_price_decimal_separator(), strval( $value ) ), $value );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt the moment I have used the following trick to detect and avoid the conversion to scientific notation:\r\n```\r\nadd_filter( 'woocommerce_format_localized_price', 'bs_fix_prices_with_scientific_notation', 1, 2 );\r\nfunction bs_fix_prices_with_scientific_notation( $string_value, $value ) {\r\n\t// Only modify the value when scientific notation is detected\r\n\treturn preg_match( '/^[+-]?(?:\\d+|\\d*\\.\\d+)[eE][+-]?\\d+$/', strval( $value ) ) ?\r\n\t\tstr_replace( '.', wc_get_price_decimal_separator(), sprintf( \"%F\", $value ) ) :\r\n\t\t$string_value;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnly replacing `strval` with `sprintf` would lead to a lot of undesired side effects in other parts of the interface, so I preferred to explicitly detect the case of scientific notation and only act in that case.\r\n\r\nSince this is a critical bug, I hope it can be fixed in WooCommerce as soon as possible. I would be glad to submit a pull request if the above approach would be considered valid (maybe there are better ways to fix the issue, i.e. let the scientific number notation be accepted when saving).\r\n\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the bug (We need to be able to reproduce the bug in order to fix it.)**\r\nSteps to reproduce the bug:\r\n1. Install WooCommerce and skip the Wizard\r\n2. In WooCommerce General setting check \"Enable tax rates and calculations\" and save\r\n3. In WooCommerce General settings set Currency to Euro, Thousand separator to `.` and decimal separator to `,` and save\r\n4. In WooCommerce Tax settings Enable option \"Round tax at subtotal level, instead of rounding per line\" and save\r\n5. In WooCommerce Tax settings ensure that the option \"Prices entered with tax\" is set to \"No, I will enter prices exclusive of tax\" and set both \"Display prices in the shop\" and \"Display prices during cart and checkout\" to \"Including tax\" and save\r\n6. In WooCommerce Tax settings - Reduced rate rates, add a row with a 4% rate valid for all countries, states, etc\r\n7. In WooCommerce Payment settings enable a payment method (i.e. Direct Bank transfer)\r\n8. Create a Product A, with a price of 20,6731€ and with tax class \"Reduced rate\"\r\n9. Create a Product B, with a price of 1,058€ and with tax class \"Reduced rate\"\r\n10. Ensure Coupons are enabled and create a coupon with an amount of 14,423077€ of type \"Fixed cart discount\"\r\n11. On the frontend add 6x Product A and 1x Product B to the cart\r\n12. Apply the previously created coupon and ensure the discount is applied and submit the order. Order total should be 115,09€\r\n13. On the backend edit the order and just hit Update. The order total gets changed to  107,09€\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![woocommerce-bug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2298248/102501855-2d992400-407e-11eb-84bd-f5e695c95723.png)\r\n\r\nSee a full video recording (4 minutes) here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TJDqD4xnmSXXv8yS5v740S9XOrTUX-xl/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n**Isolating the problem (mark completed items with an [x]):**\r\n- [x] I have deactivated other plugins and confirmed this bug occurs when only WooCommerce plugin is active.\r\n- [x] This bug happens with a default WordPress theme active, or [Storefront](https://woocommerce.com/storefront/).\r\n- [x] I can reproduce this bug consistently using the steps above.\r\n\r\n**WordPress Environment**\r\n<details>\r\n```\r\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [1891051437]"}

{"prompt":"**Is your feature request related to a problem?

Please describe.**\r\nThe current implementation of the BlockUI jQuery plugin makes it difficult to customise the overlay on the frontend without overwriting the `jQuery.fn.block` and `jQuery.fn.unblock` methods directly.\r\n\r\nThe hardcoded values of `opacity: 0.6, background: '#fff'` scattered throughout the frontend JavaScript files is particularly jarring on dark themes.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nReplace the BlockUI plugin with CSS pointer events for all frontend JS. [Browser usage is 98% globally](https://caniuse.com/pointer-events) and it is supported on all browsers on the WooCommerce/WordPress support spectrum.\r\n\r\nIdeally this would be controlled a CSS class exposed by WooCommerce for easy customisation. For example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction blockUi(element) {\r\n    element.classList.add('woo-block-ui')\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction unblockUi(element) {\r\n    element.classList.remove('woo-block-ui')\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.woo-block-ui {\r\n    pointer-events: none;\r\n    opacity: 0.6;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThemes could then easily customise the `.woo-block-ui` class for complete control.\r\n\r\nIn theory this solution should be non-breaking as any customisation to the current implementation will have required replacing/editing WooCommerce JS files or BlockUI methods.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nTo combat this currently, I have overwritten the methods exposed by the BlockUI plugin.\r\n\r\n```js\r\njQuery.fn.block = function {\r\n    this[0].classList.add('block-ui')\r\n}\r\n\r\njQuery.fn.unblock = function {\r\n    this[0].classList.remove('block-ui')\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI noticed an [open issue](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/issues/28284) that starts the discussion for potentially removing the jQuery dependency on the frontend JS.\r\n\r\nThe BlockUI plugin has [not been updated in 6 years](https://github.com/malsup/blockui) and appears to be dead. I think it's safe to say it's time to move on - at least for the frontend JavaScript.\r\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [1891051447]"}

That would make it more easy to unhook these and add custom texts.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nOf course a solution is to work with translations of these texts.

{"prompt":"Because of the use of custom post types and postmeta, WooCommerce has several places that perform double left-joins on the post/postmeta tables in order to perform lookups. Probably the desire was to be efficient by only performing one SQL query. But the query itself, because of the double-left join, is hideously inefficient and worse by several orders of magnitude than an alternative performing an extra query.\r\n\r\nAs an example, every time a new order is placed by a new customer, since there's no `_money_spent` usermeta key/value, so WooCommerce will run this monstrosity in order to help populate it (`WC_Customer_Data_Store::get_total_spent()`): (perhaps that's triggered by one of our extensions, I haven't checked, but it is run for every new customer).\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT SUM(meta2.meta_value)\r\n FROM $wpdb->posts as posts\r\n LEFT JOIN {$wpdb->postmeta} AS meta ON posts.ID = meta.post_id\r\n LEFT JOIN {$wpdb->postmeta} AS meta2 ON posts.ID = meta2.post_id\r\n WHERE   meta.meta_key       = '_customer_user'\r\n AND     meta.meta_value     = '\" . esc_sql( $customer->get_id() ) . \"'\r\n AND     posts.post_type     = 'shop_order'\r\n AND     posts.post_status   IN ( 'wc-\" . implode( \"','wc-\", $statuses ) . \"' )\r\n AND     meta2.meta_key      = '_order_total'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe effect of creating a double-left join post/postmeta is to require MySQL to row-scan a number of rows that on a typical site amounts to a number of rows that is over 80% of the number of rows found in postmeta. That, of course, is an absolute performance-killer on any site with a substantial number of orders. On one site I'm looking at, it's a row scan of over 13,000,000 rows, every time there's a new order - ouch.\r\n\r\nAs a solution, I propose that you split the processing up over two much lower-impact SQL queries, with some processing in between in PHP. First get their orders - which you'd do via `wc_get_orders()` of course, but the resulting SQL will be like:\r\n\r\n`SELECT id FROM wp_posts p, wp_postmeta pm WHERE p.id=pm.post_id AND meta_key='_customer_user' AND meta_value='123456' AND post_status IN ( ... );`\r\n\r\nOn the same site, that performs a row scan of only 1.3 % of rows - only 1/64th of the figure.\r\n\r\nThen, armed with those IDs, grab the `_order_total` meta values with a simple query on the relevant `post_id` - since both `meta_key` and `post_id` are indexed, there's no further row-scanning involved.\r\n\r\nThis is just one example of those double left-joins - there are various others in the code.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [472334370]"}

Perhaps this filter should only work if the store has set only one purchasing country. And a check within the calculate_shipping() function could determine this and automatically set the country variable from the admin settings and the single country that has been set.

The same behavior goes for a variation's shipping class field.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nA different value like `parent` in the `tax_class`/`shipping_class` field (any value that a slug cannot be set to), an empty value wouldn't work because a product's tax class could be empty when it's set to \"Standard\". Another field in the API for a variation like `tax_class_same_as_parent: Bool` could also be an option.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\n\r\n`tax_class` and `shipping_class` in the API return the same value whether the tax class for a variation is set to \"Same as parent\" or the same value as its parent product in core.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the bug (We need to be able to reproduce the bug in order to fix it.)**\r\nSteps to reproduce the bug:\r\n1.

In the variation form, set the tax class to the same tax class as its parent product --> in the API response for the variation, the `tax_class` field returns the same value as the `tax_class` field of the parent product just like in the previous step\r\n\r\n(Same steps for a variation's shipping class)\r\n\r\n<!-- Please try testing your site for theme and plugins conflict.

Please describe.\r\n\r\nFor both [woocommerce-ios](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-ios) and [woocommerce-android](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-android), we are planning on using the `wc-analytics/leaderboards` to show this UI: \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/198826/87459641-dff92680-c5c8-11ea-8b63-35f92b119f04.png\" width=\"320\">\r\n\r\nIt looks like we can use the `wc-analytics/leaderboards` API for that. However, the response looks like this:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n        {\r\n            \"id\": \"products\",\r\n            \"label\": \"Top Products - Items Sold\",\r\n            \"headers\": [\r\n                {\r\n                    \"label\": \"Product\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"label\": \"Items Sold\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"label\": \"Net Sales\"\r\n                }\r\n            ],\r\n            \"rows\": [\r\n                [\r\n                    {\r\n                        \"display\": \"<a href='https:\\/\\/brokentoys.mystagingwebsite.com\\/wp-admin\\/admin.php?page=wc-admin&path=\\/analytics\\/products&filter=single_product&products=18'>Cap<\\/a>\",\r\n                        \"value\": \"Cap\"\r\n                    },\r\n                    {\r\n                        \"display\": \"1,000\",\r\n                        \"value\": 1000\r\n                    },\r\n                    {\r\n                        \"display\": \"<span class=\\\"woocommerce-Price-amount amount\\\"><span class=\\\"woocommerce-Price-currencySymbol\\\">&#36;<\\/span>16,000.00<\\/span>\",\r\n                        \"value\": 16000\r\n                    }\r\n                ]\r\n            ]\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSome of our concerns with this:\r\n\r\n- Product name is returned as HTML. As much as possible, we'd like to avoid parsing HTML. \r\n- Product ID has to be parsed from the `<a href>`. \r\n- Product image is missing. One of the requirements is showing the image. \r\n\r\n## Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nWe're hoping that the response can be something like this:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n        {\r\n            \"ID\": 68,\r\n            \"name\": \"Aloha\",\r\n            \"total\": 46119707.10000001,\r\n            \"quantity\": 100023,\r\n            \"price\": 12,\r\n            \"image\": \"\",\r\n            \"currency\": \"CAD\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"ID\": 16,\r\n            \"name\": \"Beanie\",\r\n            \"total\": 180036,\r\n            \"quantity\": 10002,\r\n            \"price\": 20,\r\n            \"image\": \"https:\\/\\/brokentoys.mystagingwebsite.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/04\\/img_0001.png?w=1024\",\r\n            \"currency\": \"CAD\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"ID\": 18,\r\n            \"name\": \"Cap\",\r\n            \"total\": 16234,\r\n            \"quantity\": 1015,\r\n            \"price\": 10,\r\n            \"image\": \"https:\\/\\/brokentoys.mystagingwebsite.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/01\\/cap-2.jpg?w=801\",\r\n            \"currency\": \"CAD\"\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe fields shown here would be enough for us to present the UI. Additional responses are probably needed for variants. \r\n\r\n## Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nFor now, we're thinking of doing a workaround using the current endpoint. \r\n\r\n1. Fetch `wc-analytics/leaderboards`\r\n2. Parse the product IDs from the `<a href>` HTML tags.\r\n3. Fetch `/wp-json/wc/v3/products` using the `include` argument to fetch the product details. \r\n\r\n## Should this be prioritized? Why?\r\n\r\nIf this feature request is implemented, it would save us one additional API call and avoid HTML parsing which can be brittle.  \r\n\r\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [2258932484,3943104021,3943425133]"}

{"prompt":"**Prerequisites (mark completed items with an [x]):**\r\n- [X] I have have carried out troubleshooting steps and I believe I have found a bug.\r\n- [X] I have searched for similar bugs in both open and closed issues and cannot find a duplicate.\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen using \"Per Class\" calculations in the Flat Rate method (not \"Per Order\"), products of shipping classes that do not have rates entered are able to be purchased without a shipping cost, so long as other products in the cart have rates entered for their class.\r\n\r\nA common use case affected by this is related to stores that have products that are only available if purchased from specific locations. In these situations, Flat Rates are only entered for the Shipping Classes that are available in each zone and unavailable products have the rate fields left blank. This approach currently works as expected when products are purchased individually, but when the cart contains both available and unavailable products, only the rates of the available product are used and purchase is able to be completed, rather than providing the \"No shipping options were found\" message.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nSince rates do not exist for all shipping classes, no rates should be offered.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\nIf at least one of the shipping classes in the cart have rate calculated, those costs are used and products of classes that do not have rates are ignored, allowing the purchase to be completed with incorrect shipping cost calculations.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the bug (We need to be able to reproduce the bug in order to fix it.)**\r\nSteps to reproduce the bug:\r\n1. Create 2 Shipping Classes and 2 Shipping Zones (with Flat Rate added to each).\r\n2. Use the \"Per Class\" calculation type and only set rates for 1 class in each zone. My example/screenshots use the \"Austin\" class with rates in the Austin Zone and \"Texas\" class with rates in the Texas Zone.\r\n3. Calculate rates for the products individually, noticing rates are correct if they exist. If they do not exist in the matched zone, no method will be found for the class without rates entered.\r\n4. Add both products to the cart and notice that only the rates that exist in the zone are used.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nExample of Austin product being calculated for a zone with rates entered:\r\n![](https://d.pr/i/ZinD8P+)\r\n(Link to screenshot: https://d.pr/i/ZinD8P+)\r\n\r\nExample of Texas product being calculated for a zone without rates entered:\r\n![](https://d.pr/i/Y8iRSY+)\r\n(Link to screenshot: https://d.pr/i/Y8iRSY+)\r\n\r\nExample of both products being purchased at the same time and only the Austin class rates being used:\r\n![](https://d.pr/i/eL0hJm+)\r\n(Link to screenshot: https://d.pr/i/eL0hJm+)\r\n\r\n**Isolating the problem (mark completed items with an [x]):**\r\n- [X] I have deactivated other plugins and confirmed this bug occurs when only WooCommerce plugin is active.\r\n- [X] This bug happens with a default WordPress theme active, or [Storefront](https://woocommerce.com/storefront/).\r\n- [X] I can reproduce this bug consistently using the steps above.\r\n\r\n**WordPress Environment**\r\nWordPress version 5.4.2\r\nWooCommerce version 4.2.2\r\nStorefront version 2.5.8\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [1891051459]"}

{"prompt":"**Describe the issue**\r\n\r\nCertain actions may require elevated user capabilities, such as clearance to install plugins (\"Install now\"). Currently, Store Managers can attempt to perform these actions, but they will fail -- usually silently. Jetpack and WC Services appear to handle failures due to user capability limitations by adding yet another note.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest filtering out actions that can't be performed by the current user -- for example, in the case of WooCommerce Payments, Store Managers should only see the \"Learn More\" button. This can be done by selectively leaving out specific action data when a request is made in `view` context (which is probably always).\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1.

{"prompt":"**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nWhen editing a product's variations, and pressing 'save changes', all data for all variations is sent to the server. This imposes a practical limit when there are many variants. The limit is easily reached when many custom fields have been added via the hook woocommerce_product_after_variable_attributes. We have encountered this bug after adding many fields using woocommerce_product_after_variable_attributes. We hit the submission limit with only 11 variations.\r\n\r\nThis limitation is caused by the admin front-end to edit variations. The interface's accordion menu situates all fields for all variations in a single form element. So if you edit one field of one variation, all fields for all variations are submitted, this is very inefficient. A possible solution is to change the accordion interface for editing variations with an interface that edits/submits only one variation at a time. This would remove any limit on the number of variations, and would significantly raise the limit on extensions possible using woocommerce_product_after_variable_attributes.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.

{"prompt":"**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen the shipping cost = $0, the shipping rate is hidden.\r\n\r\nThis is basically fine and very avoidable if you are only using the core WooCommerce product without shipping plugins, because you could just rename the shipping method label as 'Free shipping' or '10-day delivery (Free)' or whatever you want.\r\nBut with certain shipping plugins where you are unable to easily rename the shipping method label, you can get some unexpected and confusing UI.\r\n\r\nFor example, when using the Distance Rate plugin, this is what the customer in the cart will see:\r\n\r\n![image (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65582817/82307235-a48c1280-99f2-11ea-807f-5bdbf6a43067.png)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI would expect this instead:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2020-05-19 at 5 24 05 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65582817/82309318-912e7680-99f5-11ea-836f-aa0a2668c5a6.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.

{"prompt":"**Describe the bug**\n\nThe `@woocommerce/components` `List` component renders as a `<ul>` with an ARIA role of `menu`. List items are under the `<ul>`'s `<li>`s as `<a>` links with an ARIA role of `menuitem`.\n\nOn first glance, I thought this seemed reasonable. But, after thinking about it further and doing some research, I believe that it is incorrect to apply the `menu`/`menuitem` roles for this component.\n\nFrom [W3C: Using ARIA Menus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Using_ARIA_menus):\n\n> A menu widget usually consists of a main menu bar with pop up menus. Items in pop up menus often have sub pop up menus. Menu widgets must provide keyboard support to navigate all the menu items in the menu. Keyboard support for a menu typically include the cursor keys to navigate between the menu items and open and close popupmenus. \n\nFrom [Inclusive Components: Menu & Menu Buttons](https://inclusive-components.design/menus-menu-buttons/):\n\n> ARIA menus are not designated for navigation but for application behavior. Imagine the menu system for a desktop application.\n\nMost/all of our use of `<List>` in wc-admin is for navigation. It is not similar to an application menu as found in a typical desktop application.\n\nExamples of `<List>` usage:\n- \"Set up your store and start selling\" task list on dashboard or other screens\n- \"Store management\" quick links card on homepage (in progress as of this issue creation; woocommerce/woocommerce-admin#4350)\n\nAnd on top of it using the wrong role, it doesn't even implement the `menu` role fully. Arrow keys are not available for moving between menu items.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n\n1. Go to either the \"Set up your store and start selling\" task list  or the \"Store Management\" quick links card on the homepage.\n2. Using assistive tool, or by looking at the page source, see that role of `menu`/`menuitem` is used for list.\n3. Try to up/down arrow keys to navigate between items. Verify you can't.\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nSince the usage of `<List>` is for navigation and not application behavior, I expect the `menu`/`menuitem` role to not be used. If anything, these lists should be wrapped in a `<nav>` element.\n\n**Additional context**\n\n- [W3C: Using ARIA menus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Using_ARIA_menus)\n- [Inclusive Components: Menus & Menu Buttons](https://inclusive-components.design/menus-menu-buttons/)\n- [Don't Use ARIA Menu Roles for Site Nav](https://adrianroselli.com/2017/10/dont-use-aria-menu-roles-for-site-nav.html)\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [3943104021,3943425720,702347761]"}

More info in p6riRB-5na\r\n\r\nHere's a list of elements I found that will need updating:\r\n\r\n# On-boarding\r\n* Button styling should match core. IE use the `$button-color` and `$button-text-color` variables, or better yet just remove the overrides and inherit the default styles. This applies to the big \"Let's go\" button, and the button that appears in the \"Help improve WooCommerce with usage tracking\" modal.\r\n* Timeline active / current steps should no longer be purple. Let's use `$highlight-color`.\r\n* Timeline inactive / upcoming steps should use a lightened version of `$base-color`. Let's go with 60%. The text should be `$base-color` lightened 40% to meet AA accessibility guidelines. For reference: https://cloudup.com/cnuqU_EI0sY\r\n* Inputs and checkboxes should inherit core styling, IE no overrides to change border colors, background colors, focus outlines, etc.\r\n* Text links, checked checkboxes, and toggles should use `$link`, `$link-focus`, and `$highlight-color` as appropriate.\r\n* Borders on elements like `.wc-wizard-services` should match borders on elements like the posts table in wp-admin (#ccd0d4 - doesn't like these have been updated to use variables yet, womp womp).\r\n\r\n# Elsewhere\r\n* Notices that have a purple left border should use the appropriate core color scheme. Blue for info, red for error, etc. Buttons in notices should also inherit core styling. \r\n* Buttons on empty states (orders / products / coupons etc) should use the `$button-color` and `$button-text-color` variables for coloring. Or just remove the overrides if that's easier!\r\n* Text on empty states should inherit core color schemes. IE remove colors styles applied to `.woocommerce-BlankState .woocommerce-BlankState-message`.\r\n* The green \"In stock\" label on product lists, and the green labels in the system status should match the green used for `.notice-success` - `#46b450`. This doesn't seem to be a variable yet either :(\r\n* Order notes can also use a lightened version of `$base-color`. 75% works well. System order notes can use `$base-color` lightened 60%. Reference: https://cloudup.com/cEb73PUJ8Q3\r\n* Hover styles on the legends in reports should use variations of `$highlight-color` rather than purple.\r\n* The empty methods table on the edit zone screen shouldn't include any purple elements. The background and text can inherit default color styles. The background icon can use `$icon-color`. Reference: https://cloudup.com/cBLVQeJzCWj\r\n* Any toggles in settings should use `$highlight-color` for their active states rather than purple.\r\n* `.wc-admin-breadcrumb` should inherit the default link color. IE remove the purple `color` property on this class.\r\n* `.status-enabled:before` should use `$highlight-color` instead of purple.\r\n\r\nAny questions? Please ask!\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [1891051447,702347761]"}

{"prompt":"**Describe the bug**\r\nFor some data variables in a product an array can be used, for example for the upsell_ids. When we remove elements from this array it reverts back to the old state after saving the product. So if we continue using this product in code it will contain incorrect data.\r\n\r\nThis was originally brought to light in the Bookings extension, see: https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-bookings/issues/2780\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Create a simple product with multiple upsell products assigned\r\n2. Get the ID of this product to be able to reproduce it with some code as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$product = wc_get_product( 581 );\r\n$upsells = $product->get_upsell_ids();\r\nvar_dump( 'initial', $upsells );\r\n$remove = array_pop( $upsells );\r\n\r\n$product->set_upsell_ids( $upsells );\r\nvar_dump( 'after update', $product->get_upsell_ids(), $product->get_changes() );\r\n\r\n$product->save();\r\nvar_dump( 'after save', $product->get_upsell_ids() );\r\n\r\n$product->save();\r\nvar_dump( 'second save', $product->get_upsell_ids() );\r\n```\r\n\r\nInitially `get_upsell_ids` will return: `array(2) { [0]=> int(170), [1]=> int(8) }`\r\nAfter removing and updating it will return: `array(1) { [0]=> int(170) }`\r\nAfter the first save it will return: `array(2) { [0]=> int(170), [1]=> int(8) }`\r\n\r\nIt will save the product correctly, but won't replace the data in the object correctly after saving. When saving the second time it won't do anything because the changes array is empty.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nWe would expect the product option to always contain the latest information. The reason it contains the older information is because a recursive replace is done, see: https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/3.8.1/includes/abstracts/abstract-wc-data.php#L719\r\n\r\nThis code works fine when adding elements to an array. But when removing elements from an array it doesn't update them correctly. Which is because of the following behaviour:\r\n\r\n> 1. If a key from the first array exists in the second array, its value will be replaced by the value from the second array.\r\n> 2. If the key exists in the second array, and not the first, it will be created in the first array.\r\n> 3. If a key only exists in the first array, it will be left as is.\r\n\r\nThe third point is where it doesn't remove the data from the array. One suggestion was to replace the function call with `array_replace`. Does that cause any other problems or is there a specific need to recursively walk through the arrays?\r\n\r\n**Isolating the problem (mark completed items with an [x]):**\r\n- [x] I have deactivated other plugins and confirmed this bug occurs when only WooCommerce plugin is active.\r\n- [x] This bug happens with a default WordPress theme active, or [Storefront](https://woocommerce.com/storefront/).\r\n- [x] I can reproduce this bug consistently using the steps above.\r\n\r\n**WordPress Environment**\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n```\r\nWordPress 5.3.2\r\nWooCommerce 3.8.1\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [1891051461]"}

If a template is updated the cache key needs to be flushed to reflect the new changes. Currently, there are two options:\r\n\r\n1) know the cache key to remove then run ``\r\n2) run `wp cache flush` to flush the cache of the full site. \r\n\r\nEach of these has its own setbacks. Option one requires knowledge of the key, which isn't always the easier thing to find. After being sanitized a template key looks something like `template-cartmini-cartphp woocommerce ---381`. In addition, if you change multiple templates the key will need to be flushed for each changed template. Option two is a performance concern for high traffic environments when really only a few keys need to be flushed not the whole sites.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nIt would be great to have a WC CLI command to flush the template cache. Either under `tools` or as its own command. \r\n`wp wc tool run clear_template_cache` || `wp wc template cache flush`\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nImplementing a custom CLI command to handle this.

{"prompt":"**What to improve**\r\nThe JS detection of WooCommerce is invalidating styles at the end of parsing the HTML enforcing a 'Recalculate Style' action in the browser's main thread. This slows the front-end performance and creates a worst final user experience.\r\n\r\n**In more detail**\r\nWooCommerce is adding the class `woocommerce-no-js` to the body and in the footer change it to `woocommerce-js` if JavaScript is enabled.\r\nhttps://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/master/includes/wc-template-functions.php#L316\r\n\r\nAt the point where this JS is added the browser process already parsed most of the page, and is probably in a advanced point of rendering (it may depend on lot of factors, for sure).\r\n\r\nBy changing a class in a body a re-render of the CSSOM is forced to happen. This restarts the page render and slows the final user experience. It can look insignificant but depending on the resources in the device rendering the page this can be relevant.\r\n\r\nAlso for sites who try to optimize its front-end performance will be a nice improvement.\r\n\r\n**Proposed solution**\r\nManage the CSS for non JavaScript support with `<noscript>` tag to no penalize the browsers with JS support. If browsers already know if they have JS support and have a tag for it makes sense to use it.\r\n\r\nIn detail:\r\n - Place the CSS selectors for `woocommerce-no-js` class in a dedicated file.\r\n - Link this file inInclude the header with something like:\r\n```\r\n<noscript>\r\n   <link rel='stylesheet' id='wc-no-js-css'  href='/path/to/file/woocommerce-no-js.css' type='text/css' media='all' />\r\n</noscript>\r\n```\r\n - In https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/master/includes/wc-template-functions.php remove line 306 and all the function `wc_no_js()`\r\n\r\nNote that the body selector `woocommerce-no-js` is only used here:\r\n - assets/css/twenty-nineteen.scss\r\n - assets/css/twenty-seventeen.scss\r\n - assets/css/woocommerce.scss\r\n\r\nWith the same content:\r\n```\r\n.woocommerce-no-js {\r\n      form.woocommerce-form-login,\r\n      form.woocommerce-form-coupon {\r\n              display: block !important;\r\n      }\r\n      .woocommerce-form-login-toggle,\r\n      .woocommerce-form-coupon-toggle,\r\n      .showcoupon {\r\n              display: none !important;\r\n     }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf makes sense to do this improvement I I will be happy to provide an initial patch for it.\r\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [472334370]"}

{"prompt":"The problem concerns customer payment link and custom payment gateways. The main thing is that customer can't effect payment by credit card. These (WireCard and Micropayment) and most of other plugins alike store payment data in session. Such customers usually visit web-site the first and maybe the last time. It is worth mentioning that shopping cart is empty for such customers. \r\n\r\nAfter a set of tests a problem of non-complete setting of session cookie in browser was found.  WC_Session/WC_Session_Handler classes restore woocommerce session, but check whether this cookie is based on $_COOKIE variable. During the render of 'pay-order page' WC_Session/WC_Session_Handler miss functionality for setting wc_session into $_COOKIE. Unfortunately, this functionality for setting cookie into $_COOKIE variable initializes only on the cart page or when customer adds/removes products from shopping cart. Thats why the customer hasn't got any  possibility to complete such order as payment gateway passes explicitly to woocommerce session (that wasn't completely set).\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Go on to 'pay-order' page (http://wp.artemanokhin.com/checkout/order-pay/18/?pay_for_order=true&key=wc_order_PzEY1bg8YMVfw);\r\n2.

{"prompt":"The [API  documentation](https://woocommerce.github.io/woocommerce-rest-api-docs/#refunds) for orders describes the data format for API requests for orders. Creating a refund via the REST API does not seem to follow this format. Looking at the core code in `wc_create_refund()` function reveals that the handling for line items does not match the data format described in the documentation.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Create a test order with items to refund.\r\n2. Create a JSON following the API documentation:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"line_items\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"id\": 1234, // id matching a line item\r\n            \"quantity\": 1,\r\n            \"product_id\": 5678, // id matching the line item product\r\n            \"variant_id\": 9012, // id matching the line item product variant\r\n        }\r\n    ],\r\n    \"api_refund\": false,\r\n    \"reason\": \"Testing the refund data format\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. Post this JSON to the REST API\r\n4. See the following data without the correct line item data:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"id\": 372,\r\n  \"date_created\": \"2019-05-06T11:25:12\",\r\n  \"date_created_gmt\": \"2019-05-06T08:25:12\",\r\n  \"amount\": \"0.00\",\r\n  \"reason\": \"Testing the refund data format\",\r\n  \"refunded_by\": 1,\r\n  \"meta_data\": [],\r\n  \"line_items\": [],\r\n  \"_links\": {\r\n    \"self\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"href\": \"https:\\/\\/my-site.test\\/wp-json\\/wc\\/v3\\/orders\\/361\\/refunds\\/372\"\r\n      }\r\n    ],\r\n    \"collection\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"href\": \"https:\\/\\/my-site.test\\/wp-json\\/wc\\/v3\\/orders\\/361\\/refunds\"\r\n      }\r\n    ],\r\n    \"up\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"href\": \"https:\\/\\/my-site.test\\/wp-json\\/wc\\/v3\\/orders\\/361\"\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe refund should be created for the defined line item and stocks should be recalculated based on the refunded quantity. Order total should be recalculated after the refunds.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the documentation describes the line item id as a read-only property. Thus, my example data is invalid, but I don't see any other way to match the line item other than setting the id. Looking at the code and going through issues about the refund endpoint online, I found out that the line item id should be set as an object key for the line items *object*. This means the `line_items` property should not be an array after all. This is not documented correctly. Here's a working example of how to format the object:\r\n```\r\n\t\"line_items\": {\r\n\t\t\"123\": {}\r\n\t},\r\n```\r\nHere \"123\" is the line item id. I would prefer my example formatting as it is more consistent with the GET endpoint and the current documentation.\r\n\r\nThen, the `quantity` property is not working. Again, looking at the code reveals the `wc_create_function()` function handles the quantity by a `qty` property. This is documented incorrectly.\r\n\r\nAnother incorrectly documented property for line items is the `total` property. `wc_create_refund()` expects it to come from a property called `refund_total`. This is not documented in the [order line items section](https://woocommerce.github.io/woocommerce-rest-api-docs/#order-refund-properties).\r\n\r\nThe amount handling should also be described more thoroughly. Now the order total is not refunded without a top-level property of `amount` defining the amount to be reduced from the order total. If a request with only the line item refund is made, the line item is refunded and stocks are recalculated but the order total does not change. Here's an example of a partially working line item refund request data:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n\t\"line_items\": {\r\n\t\t\"841\": {\r\n\t\t\t\"qty\": 1,\r\n\t\t\t\"product_id\": 200,\r\n\t\t\t\"variation_id\": 206,\r\n\t\t\t\"refund_total\": \"7.90\"\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t},\r\n\t\"api_refund\": false,\r\n\t\"reason\": \"Testing\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here's the fully working request:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n\t\"amount\": \"7.90\",\r\n\t\"line_items\": {\r\n\t\t\"841\": {\r\n\t\t\t\"qty\": 1,\r\n\t\t\t\"product_id\": 200,\r\n\t\t\t\"variation_id\": 206,\r\n\t\t\t\"refund_total\": \"7.90\"\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t},\r\n\t\"api_refund\": false,\r\n\t\"reason\": \"Testing\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see the documentation for creating a refund has many errors and inconsistencies. Please fix them and provide a simple and clean way of creating refunds through the REST API.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n```\r\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [2258932484]"}
