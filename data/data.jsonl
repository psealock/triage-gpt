{"context":"\n### Describe the bug\n\nAs it stands, Turborepo seems to invalidate the cache when input files change as you expect it to. For some reason, however, it looks like files aren't always being rebuilt when they should be. I think this problem is being caused by TypeScript's incremental builds. As far as I can tell, `tsc` does not always build the project when you expect it to. I have a few thoughts:\r\n\r\n* This may relate to the fact that `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` is not being cached as a build output. Is it possible this might be causing things to not be rebuilt even though they've changed? This _should_ be cached as an output, whether it's the problem or not, since it is a build artifact.\r\n* Does TypeScript pick up on the fact that the dependency has been rebuilt even though none of the output files have been rebuilt? I know TypeScript supports references and composite projects, maybe we've misconfigured something and they aren't seeing each other?\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nTypeScript should run the build when the files have changed.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nTypeScript is not running the build when the files have changed.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Run the following commands:\r\n```bash\r\ngit clean -fdx\r\npnpm install\r\n# Run the build a few times and make sure we're getting FULL TURBO each time.\r\npnpm run build --filter=@woocommerce/currency\r\n```\r\n2.

{"context":"### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nCurrently, WooCommerce only supports the PUT method for updating resources. However, there are situations where a more granular update of a resource is required, without having to send the entire resource in the request. This is where the PATCH method comes in handy.\r\n\r\nFor example, let's say you have a product in WooCommerce with multiple attributes such as title, description, price, etc. If you wanted to update just the price of the product, you would have to send the entire product object in the request body using the PUT method. This can be inefficient, especially if the product object is large.\r\n\r\nWith the PATCH method, you can send only the fields that need to be updated in the request body, thus reducing the amount of data being sent over the network. This can lead to improved performance and reduced network latency.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the PATCH method allows for partial updates of a resource, which can be useful in scenarios where you need to update only certain fields of a resource, without affecting the others.\r\n\r\nTherefore, adding support for the PATCH method in WooCommerce would provide more flexibility and efficiency in updating resources, and would align with RESTful best practices for API design.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nUsing the PUT method with the entire resource: While not as efficient as the PATCH method, using the PUT method with the entire resource would still allow for updating of the resource. This method may be sufficient for smaller resources, but could be inefficient for larger resources.\r\n\r\nCreating custom endpoints: Instead of using the existing endpoints in WooCommerce, custom endpoints could be created to support the PATCH method. This would require additional development effort but would provide more granular control over the API.\r\n\r\nUsing third-party plugins: There may be third-party plugins available that add support for the PATCH method in WooCommerce. However, using third-party plugins can introduce additional dependencies and potential security risks.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [2258932484]"}

Here, the $qty selector has changed, and instead of selecting the layer with the \"quantity\" class, as it did before, it selects the input:\r\n\r\n`$qty = form.$singleVariationWrap.find( '.quantity input[name=\"quantity\"]' ),`\r\n\r\nFor this reason the selection of the input, which is done later, does not work:\r\n\r\n`var $qty_input = $qty.find( 'input.qty' )`\r\n\r\nSince he is looking for himself ;)\r\n\r\nFor the later logic to work, the initial $qty selector must be changed to the way it was in the previous version, ie:\r\n\r\n`$qty = form.$singleVariationWrap.find( '.quantity' ),`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nQuantity input min and max attributes are updated on change of variance with stock restrictions.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe min and max attributes of the quantity input are NOT updated when changing variations with stock constraints, since the quantity input selector in the js file is incorrect.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a product with variations for some attribute.\r\n2. Manage stock for variations with different stock limits.\r\n3. In frontend, change attribute/variation option.\r\n4. The quantity input does not take into account the stock restrictions of each variation\r\n\r\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [1891051436,3837257959]"}

{"context":"> **Note**\r\n> **TL;DR** is there a way we could install and run phpcs-changed from the root of the Git repo instead of only from `plugins/woocommerce`?\r\n\r\nRight now phpcs-changed is run as part of a GitHub workflow whenever you push changes to a pull request, which is great because it only shows you linting errors on the lines you changed/added, instead of in each entire file. However, it'd be even better if I could run this command locally before I push changes up to GitHub, so I don't have to wait for all the checks to finish to know if I have linting errors.\r\n\r\nIn `plugins/woocommerce/composer.json` I see the `phpcs-pre-commit` [script](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/e05a191156aa9c59d8bf94429fba4dbc1a92519e/plugins/woocommerce/composer.json#L91-L93), but A) it doesn't seem to actually run when I attempt a commit, and B) the command doesn't work on it's own as it currently is.\r\n\r\nI have tried running phpcs-changed manually a few different ways, and there does not appear to be any way to successfully use the instance that gets installed and managed by composer in the `plugins/woocommerce` directory. What happens is, with the right command line arguments, it _can_ be run, but it shows you every linting error in each file instead of just on the changed lines.\r\n\r\nExample command, run from the `plugins/woocommerce` directory (this is to compare a PR branch to trunk, where everything has already been committed):\r\n```bash\r\ncomposer exec phpcs-changed -- -s --git --git-base trunk $(git diff $(git merge-base HEAD trunk) --name-only -- '*.php')\r\n```\r\n\r\nEventually I discovered that the issue is that you have to run the command from the directory where the composer.json file is located (`plugins/woocommerce`), but the phpcs-changed command assumes that you are in the root of the Git repository, so it can't find the files that you're specifying when it's getting the linting results from the base branch. Thus it assumes that all of the changed files are brand new and shows you every linting error.\r\n\r\nThe workaround I'm using right now is to install phpcs-changed and some other necessary packages globally and then I can run it from the Git repo root without having to go through composer. However, this is not ideal because:\r\n* It makes the monorepo less self-contained, and takes us farther away from the goal of having everything ready to go after just running the install command.\r\n* I think it would actually be great if phpcs-changed could be run on the pre-commit hook.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [3844183371]"}

So, those methods generate errors in some special cases. For example, if the `post_status` is `auto-draft`.

{"context":"### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n### Context\r\n\r\nIn Rukib team, we are maintaining the [WooCommerce Blocks](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks) plugin! Couple of months ago we did a research spike (pdFofs-mB-p2) about managing extensions that don't support the Cart & Checkout Blocks. One of our propositions was to declare (in)compatibility with the C&C Blocks (pdFofs-mB-p2#declare-in-compatibility-with-the-cart-checkout-blocks) using the same approach in [HPOS compatibility declaration](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/wiki/High-Performance-Order-Storage-Upgrade-Recipe-Book#declaring-extension-incompatibility). During one of our pair programming and brainstorming sessions (pca54o-4NP-p2#declaring-in-compatibly-with-the-c-c-blocks) we worked in creating a prouf of concept for declaring (in)compatibility with the Cart & Checkout Blocks feature.\r\n\r\nDeclaring (in)compatibility is simple:\r\n- Declare WC tested up to in the main plugin file(s)\r\n- Add the correct code snippet to the main plugin file(s)\r\n\r\nThe code snippet used for declaring (in)compatibility with [HPOS](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/wiki/High-Performance-Order-Storage-Upgrade-Recipe-Book#declaring-extension-incompatibility):\r\n\r\n```PHP\r\nadd_action( 'before_woocommerce_init', function() {\r\n    if ( class_exists( '\\Automattic\\WooCommerce\\Utilities\\FeaturesUtil' ) ) {\r\n        \\Automattic\\WooCommerce\\Utilities\\FeaturesUtil::declare_compatibility( 'custom_order_tables', __FILE__, true );\r\n    }\r\n} );\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, the function of interest is: `declare_compatibility( 'custom_order_tables', FILE, true );`, see [function definition](https://href.li/?https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/trunk/plugins/woocommerce/src/Utilities/FeaturesUtil.php#L45-L67):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/c3d62f113addbbf820ed5e8103a0a052092efc00/plugins/woocommerce/src/Utilities/FeaturesUtil.php#L45-L67\r\n\r\nIn theory, we want to replace the `custom_order_tables` feature_id by a C&C Blocks feature_id (e.g., `cart_checkout_blocks`). During our research, we realized that only the WooCommerce features in `WooCommerce -> Settings -> Advanced -> Features` can use the `declare_compatibility` function:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14235870/212312501-2ee56ff3-b78e-4f53-93bc-675947ed8071.png)\r\n\r\nIn other words, the current implementation of the `declare_compatibility` function doesn’t work for the Cart & Checkout Blocks feature.\r\n\r\n### Solutions\r\n\r\nI this case, we have two options:\r\n\r\n- In Woo Blocks, create the compatibility declaration API from scratch. This, I believe, is a bad idea: we will duplicate the same feature, and we will not have a single source of truth!\r\n- Add support for the Cart & Checkout Blocks in the declaring compatibility feature\r\n\r\nWe eventually chose to go with the second solution!\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [3834300886,3837257959]"}

However all these third parties only partially support WooCommerce because there is no return management system. Such a system needs the following functionality\r\n- Register a return\r\n- Apply different states to a return (eg. Expected, In Progress, Approved, Completed)\r\n- Refund the return or create a coupon\r\n\r\nAll the other big E-commerce platforms already have this functionality.\r\n- Shopify\r\n- Lightspeed\r\n- Magento 1 & Magento 2\r\n- Shopware\r\n- BigCommerce\r\n\r\nThe third parties(multiple) advise us explicitly to switch to a different platform. Which is something we are almost forced to do to keep everything running operationally.\r\n\r\nSure there are some plugins that can do this but third parties don't support plugin functionality but only core functionality.

Otherwise it fails to fulfill it's contract, which suggests that any call to `$logger->debug($message, $context);` will store message with some additional information, oftentimes crutial for debug purposes.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nThis issue is clearly visible when customer experiences some issues during checkout, resulting in caught `Exception` (as presented [in `WC_Order` class](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/trunk/plugins/woocommerce/includes/class-wc-order.php#L149-L163)).\r\n\r\nWooCommerce is requested to log information about error in completing payment along with current order and whole exception passed as context meaningful to this issue, potentially helpful for debugging.\r\n\r\nYet, as one may see, log handler decides to [drop any context](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/trunk/plugins/woocommerce/includes/abstracts/abstract-wc-log-handler.php#L44) from saved message.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.

{"context":"### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI suggest to upgrade the importer about the Date sale price ends field to have the same behaviour as the product update in admin interface to avoid inconsistency of the data imported.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nThe supported format by the importer is YYYY-MM-DD, i think is fine but need to save the timestamp as YYYY-MM-DD 23:59:59 just like on product update.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nImporting the Date sale price field the format supported YYYY-MM-DD, the importer saves the date specified at time 00:00:00 inside the database.\r\n\r\nIn admin edit product side, editing the same product imported from CSV, after update converts the same date to 23:59:59 (like suggested from Woocommerce).\r\n\r\nThat behaviour is very inconsistent because managing to import from CSV a product with Date sale end at YYYY-MM-DD 00:00:00, as soon as the product will be updated from a user in admin the sale end is automatically shifted to YYYY-MM-DD 23:59:59.\r\nAt the same time can't managed  a import from CSV with a date YYYY-MM-DD 23:59:59 because the format is not datetime but date only.\r\n\r\nA little example with numbers:\r\n1. Import 100 products with the same date sale ends to 2022-10-10 \r\n2. WooCommerce Importer save that date for the price sale end to all 100 products at 2022-10-10 00:00:00\r\n3. Me or other user needs to edit a product in admin interface (for any reason, not necessary sales related) and inside the editing form is correctly filled 2022-10-10 as the date of the end of sale price.\r\n4. On product save, WooCommerce save again the value of Date sales ends for the product at 2022-10-10 23:59:59\r\n5. When the calendar and the clock in the real life reach 2022-10-10 00:00:00 99 products shows the original price but the edited keep showing the sale price until 23:59:59 of the same day\r\n\r\nThat can be avoided by checking the date before the save and change 2022-10-10 to 2022-10-09, but i don't think is reasonable, at least not reasonable for a programmer XD.\r\nThe other way is using a hook filter to change the timestamp saving on import, but why admin interface and importer must invalidate each other? I was struggling between post this in bug section or in enhancement.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you need the steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Install WooCommerce in a clean Wordpress installation\r\n2. Create a product named \"Test\" with regular price to 10\r\n3. Export the product with these columns (ID,Date sale price ends,Sale price)\r\n4. Edit the exported CSV with the current day you are doing this below \"Date sale price ends\" column\r\n5. Edit the exported CSV with 5 below \"Sale price\" column\r\n6. Import the CSV to update \"Test\" product by ID\r\n7. Visit the product in frontend, should be shown with the regular price 10 without any sale (because now the date is the 00:00:00 of today)\r\n8. Enter inside the product edit in admin\r\n9. Press Update button doing nothing else\r\n10. Visit the product in frontend, should be shown with sale price (because now the date is the 23:59:59 of today)\r\n\r\nThanks for reading, i wanted to be more clear and specific as possible because are years now that i'm experiencing this and now i decided to write here.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [3837257959]"}

By default, all attributes are created globally. We inform the user about this in the add attributes modal.\r\n- [ ] Each product option can be edited through a modal, where it will be possible to change the option name, add/remove values, define a default value, and define if it should be displayed to customers  (local vs global): BaoQ3PGPnhAiJCsJtxgej3-fi-102%3A2377&t=EFqwqGcibTmy71Eq-0\r\n- [ ] The first variation in each option is selected by default on the product page. Users can remove it by selecting `None` from the `Default value (optional` dropdown in the option edit modal (in the current experience, we don't have a default value selected, which causes some quirky behaviors). When `None` is selected for all options, no variation will be selected when the user enters the page.\r\n- [ ] Each option should have the box 'Show in product details' unchecked by default.\r\n- [ ] Local attributes are marked with a small info icon. It is displayed in the Attributes and Options lists.

For example, the slugs for Color and Color would be ‘color’ and ‘color-2’.\r\n- [x] Users need to go to the Attributes screen, to edit the attribute advanced details such as slug or archive.\r\n- [ ] The variation list should be updated if the user adds or removes values. For example, if the user adds a new value to a \"Size\" option, we should auto-create all the new variations based on the new size value.\r\n- [x] When at least one option is created, we should automatically create variations from all options.

If the attribute is added in the options section, the flag will be enabled. There will be no way to enable or disable the flag once the attribute is added. To do that, users need to remove an attribute and add it in a different section: Attributes -> Options or Options -> Attributes.\r\n- [x] If an attribute is added in one section, it can’t be selected in another. Users have to remove it from one section and add it to another.

{"context":":**\r\nVendor/Partner request: Our Bulk Table Editor uses date + time to schedule sales. Customers is complaining about the sale is not ending. We did some research and found that the cron job for sales ( wc_scheduled_sales ) just runs once a day. So having a sale from 09:00 to 12:00 the same day (or the like) is not possible anymore. This used to work. We manually changed this cron job to run every minute and problem solved. I think many WooCommerce users think that once a day is OK but if you schedule a sale using time it will not do. So our suggestion is: 1. In WooCommerce settings make an option to change this cron job. 2. Make a hook (filter) so developers can change the sales cron job (recurrence).

{"context":"### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- [X] I have carried out troubleshooting steps and I believe I have found a bug.\r\n- [X] I have searched for similar bugs in both open and closed issues and cannot find a duplicate.\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nIn WooCommerce Payments, we display a task list in Payments > Overview, using [`CollapsibleList`](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/trunk/packages/js/experimental/src/experimental-list/collapsible-list/index.tsx) and [`TaskItem`](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/trunk/packages/js/experimental/src/experimental-list/task-item/index.tsx) from '@woocommerce/experimental' (see [here](https://github.com/Automattic/woocommerce-payments/blob/0b2030b7a99210461f5a3a35b97f9400a3a1654c/client/overview/task-list/index.js#L177-L219));\r\n\r\nWe noticed that the dismiss action from the ellipses menu gets cut off when we open it. The text is not readable and it's impossible to dismiss the task (see the issue raised: https://github.com/Automattic/woocommerce-payments/issues/4470).\r\nThis is only happening when the Gutenberg plugin is also installed. Gutenberg comes with `@wordpress/components` v20.0.0 and WooCommerce Payments bundles v11.1.5, so once Gutenberg is installed, the site is using v20.0.0.\r\n\r\n![Screen Recording 7-21-2022 at 8 45 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5121465/180345688-ef7d402b-499e-4ee1-a438-9a727309f0e8.gif)\r\n\r\nThe same behavior can be observed in the TaskList StoryBook: https://woocommerce.github.io/woocommerce-admin/components/storybook/?path=/story/woocommerce-admin-experimental-list--task-item-example\r\n\r\nIt looks like this is due to a change in how the ellipsis menu is built in `@wordpress/components`. There used to be a `position: fixed` on one of the `<div>` from the ellipsis menu (v11.1.5), and I can see now that it uses `position: absolute`. \r\nAnd the TaskItem defines a class with an `overflow: hidden` rule (see [here](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/ea6a0d31f999a60f99b3625071b860476255629a/plugins/woocommerce-admin/client/tasks/task-list.scss#L2)), which now affects the absolute positioned div from the menu (while it had no effects on it when it was fixed).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28830738/191742281-e796e546-5ce6-4e8f-a271-201730f20c67.png)\r\n\r\nWe may just need to remove the `position: relative` on `woocommerce-experimental-list__item` and move it one level up, to avoid having the absolute div relatively positioned to the element with hidden overflow.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nWhen clicking on the ellipsis menu from a task, we can see the content and dismiss the task.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nWhen clicking on the ellipsis menu from a task, we cannot see the content and dismiss the task.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Go to https://woocommerce.github.io/woocommerce-admin/components/storybook/?path=/story/woocommerce-admin-experimental-list--task-item-example\r\n2. Click on the ellipsis menu and observe that the content cannot be seen properly\r\n\r\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [3943193285,3943424887]"}

The `assets/client/admin` folder exists but it's empty.\r\n\r\nThis is also causing the E2E tests to fail, since as part of the tests setup a key is created using the said settings page.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe requested file exists and the error doesn't appear, the key creation succeeds and so do the E2E tests.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Start with a fresh clone of the WooCommerce repository in `trunk`\r\n2. `pnpm install`, then `pnpm run build`\r\n3. Notice how `plugins/woocommerce/assets/client/admin` folder exists and is empty\r\n4. Try to create a REST API key by going to Settings - Advanced - REST API - Add key and see the described behavior\r\n\r\nPossibly related: `pnpm run build` does actually succeed for 22 tasks and fails for the last one:\r\n\r\n> ERROR in client/tasks/fills/tax/woocommerce-tax/plugins.tsx:77:5\r\nwoocommerce/client/admin:turbo:build: TS2322: Type '{ onComplete: (activatedPlugins: string[], response: InstallPluginsResponse) => void; onError: (errors: unknown, response: unknown) => void; onSkip: () => void; skipText: string; onAbort: () => void; abortText: string; }' is not assignable to type 'IntrinsicAttributes & { children?: ReactNode; }'.\r\n\r\nIn WooCommerce 6.9.3 22 tasks succeed and none fails.\r\n\r\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [3837257959,3943104021]"}

The code responsible for this can be found [here](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/trunk/plugins/woocommerce/templates/global/quantity-input.php#L20-L25). I think the reasoning behind it could be that if the user cannot set the quantity of the product anyways, then what's the point of showing input box. \r\n\r\nHowever, this creates an issue that the user does not know what the quantity is, so IMO it's better if the quantity input is disabled when `min_qty=max_qty`.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nInput quantity is shown when min_qty=max_qty\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nInput quantity is not shown when min_qty=max_qty\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

I would like to have their names coded as just < p> < span> or similar, just not as a heading tag.\r\n\r\nMy dev said that \"we can't change that section product title tag from h2 to span..as its coming from product loop... if we change it will effect whole site product title.\" I agree that I do not want the Product Titles changed anywhere else. I only want the Heading tag changed in the Related Product section on each product page. I want the rest of the site operating as it is now.\r\n\r\nThe link for the page in this example is [https://canberradiamondblade.com.au/product/lawnmower-for-sale-lc19/] but I would like a fix to cover all the Related Product section on all product pages in my site not just this one.\r\n\r\nMy website uses Woocommerce, Blocksy Theme, and Yoast SEO if this is relevant.\r\n\r\nI have spoken to Blocksy and they said that custom coding can fix it, but they can't help as it Woocommerce.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [3837257959]"}

'kr' is the currency sign, not the currency symbol.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem because now when you call `get_woocommerce_currency_symbol()` it returns 'kr', which in turn has broken some of our plugins.\r\n\r\nThe workaround seems to be to use `get_woocommerce_currency()`, even though that is less intuitive that using `get_woocommerce_currency_symbol()`.\r\n\r\nResponsible commit: https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/pull/33509/commits/d2f7ea07749c4e3a0979315baacfd77936ca654d\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI expect `get_woocommerce_currency_symbol()` to return 'DKK'.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nIt returns the currency sign: 'kr'.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nSet up a site to use the danish currency and see.\r\n\r\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [3837257959]"}

{"context":"### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nThere are lots of cases where a variant can have attributes that differs from the parent, but are not defining the variant. Obvious cases like UPC/EAN/GTIN etc are of course there, but these can be solved with meta data (even though it is kind of not-great for end users).\r\n\r\n### Real life examples\r\n**Life jackets**\r\nLife jackets are typically sized by a interval of heights of the user - \"20 - 30 kg\", \"25 - 40 kg\". By adding `20,21,...30` to the former and `25,26,...40` on an attibute \"Fits weights\" to the latter we can enable a very nice filter on category pages where the customer can pick their weight and see all life jackets that fits them. Since every product has more than one value (20-30 is obviously 10 values) we can not use it for variants. \r\n\r\n**Bike tires**\r\nTires are variantized by it's dimensions (width and height). Wide tires **fits for** mountainbikes, while narrow tires **fits for** racing bikes. To allow customers to (in the category \"Bike tires\") filter by Suitable for (mountainbike|racing bike), we would need to assign that attribute to the variants. If we assign both values to the parent, the filter will be wrong as soon as one of the variants are out of stock (or hidden by any other setting such as visibility, unpublished etc).\r\n\r\nI can go on forever, but I think the uses cases should be clear. Magento and most other platforms have solved this. It would make the PIM part of WooCommerce a great deal more flexible.\r\n\r\nFrom a database perspective, I can not see why this should be very hard to implement. Most of the functionality is actually already there (thanks to the `wp_wc_product_attributes_lookup` table). Since the variants are in fact stored as separate products (posts) it should be fairly straight forward.\r\n\r\nIs there a reason/decision taken why this is not possible? If not, would it be of interest if i tried to take a stab at an implementation?\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [1891051456,3837257959]"}
