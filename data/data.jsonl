{"prompt":"\n### Describe the bug\n\nAs it stands, Turborepo seems to invalidate the cache when input files change as you expect it to. For some reason, however, it looks like files aren't always being rebuilt when they should be. I think this problem is being caused by TypeScript's incremental builds. As far as I can tell, `tsc` does not always build the project when you expect it to. I have a few thoughts:\r\n\r\n* This may relate to the fact that `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` is not being cached as a build output. Is it possible this might be causing things to not be rebuilt even though they've changed? This _should_ be cached as an output, whether it's the problem or not, since it is a build artifact.\r\n* Does TypeScript pick up on the fact that the dependency has been rebuilt even though none of the output files have been rebuilt? I know TypeScript supports references and composite projects, maybe we've misconfigured something and they aren't seeing each other?\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nTypeScript should run the build when the files have changed.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nTypeScript is not running the build when the files have changed.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Run the following commands:\r\n```bash\r\ngit clean -fdx\r\npnpm install\r\n# Run the build a few times and make sure we're getting FULL TURBO each time.\r\npnpm run build --filter=@woocommerce/currency\r\n```\r\n2.

{"prompt":"### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nCurrently, WooCommerce only supports the PUT method for updating resources. However, there are situations where a more granular update of a resource is required, without having to send the entire resource in the request. This is where the PATCH method comes in handy.\r\n\r\nFor example, let's say you have a product in WooCommerce with multiple attributes such as title, description, price, etc. If you wanted to update just the price of the product, you would have to send the entire product object in the request body using the PUT method. This can be inefficient, especially if the product object is large.\r\n\r\nWith the PATCH method, you can send only the fields that need to be updated in the request body, thus reducing the amount of data being sent over the network. This can lead to improved performance and reduced network latency.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the PATCH method allows for partial updates of a resource, which can be useful in scenarios where you need to update only certain fields of a resource, without affecting the others.\r\n\r\nTherefore, adding support for the PATCH method in WooCommerce would provide more flexibility and efficiency in updating resources, and would align with RESTful best practices for API design.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nUsing the PUT method with the entire resource: While not as efficient as the PATCH method, using the PUT method with the entire resource would still allow for updating of the resource. This method may be sufficient for smaller resources, but could be inefficient for larger resources.\r\n\r\nCreating custom endpoints: Instead of using the existing endpoints in WooCommerce, custom endpoints could be created to support the PATCH method. This would require additional development effort but would provide more granular control over the API.\r\n\r\nUsing third-party plugins: There may be third-party plugins available that add support for the PATCH method in WooCommerce. However, using third-party plugins can introduce additional dependencies and potential security risks.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [2258932484]"}

Here, the $qty selector has changed, and instead of selecting the layer with the \"quantity\" class, as it did before, it selects the input:\r\n\r\n`$qty = form.$singleVariationWrap.find( '.quantity input[name=\"quantity\"]' ),`\r\n\r\nFor this reason the selection of the input, which is done later, does not work:\r\n\r\n`var $qty_input = $qty.find( 'input.qty' )`\r\n\r\nSince he is looking for himself ;)\r\n\r\nFor the later logic to work, the initial $qty selector must be changed to the way it was in the previous version, ie:\r\n\r\n`$qty = form.$singleVariationWrap.find( '.quantity' ),`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nQuantity input min and max attributes are updated on change of variance with stock restrictions.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe min and max attributes of the quantity input are NOT updated when changing variations with stock constraints, since the quantity input selector in the js file is incorrect.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a product with variations for some attribute.\r\n2. Manage stock for variations with different stock limits.\r\n3. In frontend, change attribute/variation option.\r\n4.

{"prompt":"> **Note**\r\n> **TL;DR** is there a way we could install and run phpcs-changed from the root of the Git repo instead of only from `plugins/woocommerce`?\r\n\r\nRight now phpcs-changed is run as part of a GitHub workflow whenever you push changes to a pull request, which is great because it only shows you linting errors on the lines you changed/added, instead of in each entire file. However, it'd be even better if I could run this command locally before I push changes up to GitHub, so I don't have to wait for all the checks to finish to know if I have linting errors.\r\n\r\nIn `plugins/woocommerce/composer.json` I see the `phpcs-pre-commit` [script](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/e05a191156aa9c59d8bf94429fba4dbc1a92519e/plugins/woocommerce/composer.json#L91-L93), but A) it doesn't seem to actually run when I attempt a commit, and B) the command doesn't work on it's own as it currently is.\r\n\r\nI have tried running phpcs-changed manually a few different ways, and there does not appear to be any way to successfully use the instance that gets installed and managed by composer in the `plugins/woocommerce` directory. What happens is, with the right command line arguments, it _can_ be run, but it shows you every linting error in each file instead of just on the changed lines.\r\n\r\nExample command, run from the `plugins/woocommerce` directory (this is to compare a PR branch to trunk, where everything has already been committed):\r\n```bash\r\ncomposer exec phpcs-changed -- -s --git --git-base trunk $(git diff $(git merge-base HEAD trunk) --name-only -- '*.php')\r\n```\r\n\r\nEventually I discovered that the issue is that you have to run the command from the directory where the composer.json file is located (`plugins/woocommerce`), but the phpcs-changed command assumes that you are in the root of the Git repository, so it can't find the files that you're specifying when it's getting the linting results from the base branch. Thus it assumes that all of the changed files are brand new and shows you every linting error.\r\n\r\nThe workaround I'm using right now is to install phpcs-changed and some other necessary packages globally and then I can run it from the Git repo root without having to go through composer. However, this is not ideal because:\r\n* It makes the monorepo less self-contained, and takes us farther away from the goal of having everything ready to go after just running the install command.\r\n* I think it would actually be great if phpcs-changed could be run on the pre-commit hook.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [3844183371]"}

{"prompt":"### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n### Context\r\n\r\nIn Rukib team, we are maintaining the [WooCommerce Blocks](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks) plugin! Couple of months ago we did a research spike (pdFofs-mB-p2) about managing extensions that don't support the Cart & Checkout Blocks. One of our propositions was to declare (in)compatibility with the C&C Blocks (pdFofs-mB-p2#declare-in-compatibility-with-the-cart-checkout-blocks) using the same approach in [HPOS compatibility declaration](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/wiki/High-Performance-Order-Storage-Upgrade-Recipe-Book#declaring-extension-incompatibility). During one of our pair programming and brainstorming sessions (pca54o-4NP-p2#declaring-in-compatibly-with-the-c-c-blocks) we worked in creating a prouf of concept for declaring (in)compatibility with the Cart & Checkout Blocks feature.\r\n\r\nDeclaring (in)compatibility is simple:\r\n- Declare WC tested up to in the main plugin file(s)\r\n- Add the correct code snippet to the main plugin file(s)\r\n\r\nThe code snippet used for declaring (in)compatibility with [HPOS](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/wiki/High-Performance-Order-Storage-Upgrade-Recipe-Book#declaring-extension-incompatibility):\r\n\r\n```PHP\r\nadd_action( 'before_woocommerce_init', function() {\r\n    if ( class_exists( '\\Automattic\\WooCommerce\\Utilities\\FeaturesUtil' ) ) {\r\n        \\Automattic\\WooCommerce\\Utilities\\FeaturesUtil::declare_compatibility( 'custom_order_tables', __FILE__, true );\r\n    }\r\n} );\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, the function of interest is: `declare_compatibility( 'custom_order_tables', FILE, true );`, see [function definition](https://href.li/?https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/trunk/plugins/woocommerce/src/Utilities/FeaturesUtil.php#L45-L67):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/c3d62f113addbbf820ed5e8103a0a052092efc00/plugins/woocommerce/src/Utilities/FeaturesUtil.php#L45-L67\r\n\r\nIn theory, we want to replace the `custom_order_tables` feature_id by a C&C Blocks feature_id (e.g., `cart_checkout_blocks`). During our research, we realized that only the WooCommerce features in `WooCommerce -> Settings -> Advanced -> Features` can use the `declare_compatibility` function:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14235870/212312501-2ee56ff3-b78e-4f53-93bc-675947ed8071.png)\r\n\r\nIn other words, the current implementation of the `declare_compatibility` function doesn’t work for the Cart & Checkout Blocks feature.\r\n\r\n### Solutions\r\n\r\nI this case, we have two options:\r\n\r\n- In Woo Blocks, create the compatibility declaration API from scratch. This, I believe, is a bad idea: we will duplicate the same feature, and we will not have a single source of truth!\r\n- Add support for the Cart & Checkout Blocks in the declaring compatibility feature\r\n\r\nWe eventually chose to go with the second solution!\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [3834300886,3837257959]"}

Select a product filter\r\n3. watch as the website redirects you to the hello world post instead of filtering the products\n\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [1891051461]"}
