{"prompt":"Currently, WooCommerce only supports the PUT method for updating resources. However, there are situations where a more granular update of a resource is required, without having to send the entire resource in the request. This is where the PATCH method comes in handy.\r\n\r\nFor example, let's say you have a product in WooCommerce with multiple attributes such as title, description, price, etc. If you wanted to update just the price of the product, you would have to send the entire product object in the request body using the PUT method. This can be inefficient, especially if the product object is large.\r\n\r\nWith the PATCH method, you can send only the fields that need to be updated in the request body, thus reducing the amount of data being sent over the network. This can lead to improved performance and reduced network latency.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the PATCH method allows for partial updates of a resource, which can be useful in scenarios where you need to update only certain fields of a resource, without affecting the others.\r\n\r\nTherefore, adding support for the PATCH method in WooCommerce would provide more flexibility and efficiency in updating resources, and would align with RESTful best practices for API design.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nUsing the PUT method with the entire resource: While not as efficient as the PATCH method, using the PUT method with the entire resource would still allow for updating of the resource. This method may be sufficient for smaller resources, but could be inefficient for larger resources.\r\n\r\nCreating custom endpoints: Instead of using the existing endpoints in WooCommerce, custom endpoints could be created to support the PATCH method. This would require additional development effort but would provide more granular control over the API.\r\n\r\nUsing third-party plugins: There may be third-party plugins available that add support for the PATCH method in WooCommerce. However, using third-party plugins can introduce additional dependencies and potential security risks.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [2258932484]"}

Couple of months ago we did a research spike (pdFofs-mB-p2) about managing extensions that don't support the Cart & Checkout Blocks. One of our propositions was to declare (in)compatibility with the C&C Blocks (pdFofs-mB-p2#declare-in-compatibility-with-the-cart-checkout-blocks) using the same approach in [HPOS compatibility declaration](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/wiki/High-Performance-Order-Storage-Upgrade-Recipe-Book#declaring-extension-incompatibility). During one of our pair programming and brainstorming sessions (pca54o-4NP-p2#declaring-in-compatibly-with-the-c-c-blocks) we worked in creating a prouf of concept for declaring (in)compatibility with the Cart & Checkout Blocks feature.\r\n\r\nDeclaring (in)compatibility is simple:\r\n- Declare WC tested up to in the main plugin file(s)\r\n- Add the correct code snippet to the main plugin file(s)\r\n\r\nThe code snippet used for declaring (in)compatibility with [HPOS](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/wiki/High-Performance-Order-Storage-Upgrade-Recipe-Book#declaring-extension-incompatibility):\r\n\r\n```PHP\r\nadd_action( 'before_woocommerce_init', function() {\r\n    if ( class_exists( '\\Automattic\\WooCommerce\\Utilities\\FeaturesUtil' ) ) {\r\n        \\Automattic\\WooCommerce\\Utilities\\FeaturesUtil::declare_compatibility( 'custom_order_tables', __FILE__, true );\r\n    }\r\n} );\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, the function of interest is: `declare_compatibility( 'custom_order_tables', FILE, true );`, see [function definition](https://href.li/?https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/trunk/plugins/woocommerce/src/Utilities/FeaturesUtil.php#L45-L67):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/c3d62f113addbbf820ed5e8103a0a052092efc00/plugins/woocommerce/src/Utilities/FeaturesUtil.php#L45-L67\r\n\r\nIn theory, we want to replace the `custom_order_tables` feature_id by a C&C Blocks feature_id (e.g., `cart_checkout_blocks`). During our research, we realized that only the WooCommerce features in `WooCommerce -> Settings -> Advanced -> Features` can use the `declare_compatibility` function:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14235870/212312501-2ee56ff3-b78e-4f53-93bc-675947ed8071.png)\r\n\r\nIn other words, the current implementation of the `declare_compatibility` function doesn‚Äôt work for the Cart & Checkout Blocks feature.\r\n\r\n### Solutions\r\n\r\nI this case, we have two options:\r\n\r\n- In Woo Blocks, create the compatibility declaration API from scratch.

By default, all attributes are created globally. We inform the user about this in the add attributes modal.\r\n- [ ] Each product option can be edited through a modal, where it will be possible to change the option name, add/remove values, define a default value, and define if it should be displayed to customers  (local vs global): BaoQ3PGPnhAiJCsJtxgej3-fi-102%3A2377&t=EFqwqGcibTmy71Eq-0\r\n- [ ] The first variation in each option is selected by default on the product page. Users can remove it by selecting `None` from the `Default value (optional` dropdown in the option edit modal (in the current experience, we don't have a default value selected, which causes some quirky behaviors). When `None` is selected for all options, no variation will be selected when the user enters the page.\r\n- [ ] Each option should have the box 'Show in product details' unchecked by default.\r\n- [ ] Local attributes are marked with a small info icon.

If the attribute is added in the options section, the flag will be enabled. There will be no way to enable or disable the flag once the attribute is added. To do that, users need to remove an attribute and add it in a different section: Attributes -> Options or Options -> Attributes.\r\n- [x] If an attribute is added in one section, it can‚Äôt be selected in another.

{"prompt":"In WooCommerce Payments, we display a task list in Payments > Overview, using [`CollapsibleList`](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/trunk/packages/js/experimental/src/experimental-list/collapsible-list/index.tsx) and [`TaskItem`](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/trunk/packages/js/experimental/src/experimental-list/task-item/index.tsx) from '@woocommerce/experimental' (see [here](https://github.com/Automattic/woocommerce-payments/blob/0b2030b7a99210461f5a3a35b97f9400a3a1654c/client/overview/task-list/index.js#L177-L219));\r\n\r\nWe noticed that the dismiss action from the ellipses menu gets cut off when we open it. The text is not readable and it's impossible to dismiss the task (see the issue raised: https://github.com/Automattic/woocommerce-payments/issues/4470).\r\nThis is only happening when the Gutenberg plugin is also installed. Gutenberg comes with `@wordpress/components` v20.0.0 and WooCommerce Payments bundles v11.1.5, so once Gutenberg is installed, the site is using v20.0.0.\r\n\r\n![Screen Recording 7-21-2022 at 8 45 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5121465/180345688-ef7d402b-499e-4ee1-a438-9a727309f0e8.gif)\r\n\r\nThe same behavior can be observed in the TaskList StoryBook: https://woocommerce.github.io/woocommerce-admin/components/storybook/?path=/story/woocommerce-admin-experimental-list--task-item-example\r\n\r\nIt looks like this is due to a change in how the ellipsis menu is built in `@wordpress/components`. There used to be a `position: fixed` on one of the `<div>` from the ellipsis menu (v11.1.5), and I can see now that it uses `position: absolute`. \r\nAnd the TaskItem defines a class with an `overflow: hidden` rule (see [here](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/ea6a0d31f999a60f99b3625071b860476255629a/plugins/woocommerce-admin/client/tasks/task-list.scss#L2)), which now affects the absolute positioned div from the menu (while it had no effects on it when it was fixed).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28830738/191742281-e796e546-5ce6-4e8f-a271-201730f20c67.png)\r\n\r\nWe may just need to remove the `position: relative` on `woocommerce-experimental-list__item` and move it one level up, to avoid having the absolute div relatively positioned to the element with hidden overflow.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nWhen clicking on the ellipsis menu from a task, we can see the content and dismiss the task.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nWhen clicking on the ellipsis menu from a task, we cannot see the content and dismiss the task.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Go to https://woocommerce.github.io/woocommerce-admin/components/storybook/?path=/story/woocommerce-admin-experimental-list--task-item-example\r\n2. Click on the ellipsis menu and observe that the content cannot be seen properly\r\n\r\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [3943424887]"}

{"prompt":"undefinedHi,\r\n\r\nThere are lots of cases where a variant can have attributes that differs from the parent, but are not defining the variant. Obvious cases like UPC/EAN/GTIN etc are of course there, but these can be solved with meta data (even though it is kind of not-great for end users).\r\n\r\n### Real life examples\r\n**Life jackets**\r\nLife jackets are typically sized by a interval of heights of the user - \"20 - 30 kg\", \"25 - 40 kg\". By adding `20,21,...30` to the former and `25,26,...40` on an attibute \"Fits weights\" to the latter we can enable a very nice filter on category pages where the customer can pick their weight and see all life jackets that fits them. Since every product has more than one value (20-30 is obviously 10 values) we can not use it for variants. \r\n\r\n**Bike tires**\r\nTires are variantized by it's dimensions (width and height). Wide tires **fits for** mountainbikes, while narrow tires **fits for** racing bikes. To allow customers to (in the category \"Bike tires\") filter by Suitable for (mountainbike|racing bike), we would need to assign that attribute to the variants. If we assign both values to the parent, the filter will be wrong as soon as one of the variants are out of stock (or hidden by any other setting such as visibility, unpublished etc).\r\n\r\nI can go on forever, but I think the uses cases should be clear. Magento and most other platforms have solved this. It would make the PIM part of WooCommerce a great deal more flexible.\r\n\r\nFrom a database perspective, I can not see why this should be very hard to implement. Most of the functionality is actually already there (thanks to the `wp_wc_product_attributes_lookup` table). Since the variants are in fact stored as separate products (posts) it should be fairly straight forward.\r\n\r\nIs there a reason/decision taken why this is not possible? If not, would it be of interest if i tried to take a stab at an implementation?\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_\n\n###\n\n","completion":" [1891051456]"}
